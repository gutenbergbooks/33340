<h1><a name="Weighed" id="Weighed">Weighed in the
Balances</a></h1>
<p class="pn">I<span class="sc">n</span> the fifth chapter of
Daniel we read the history of King Belshazzar. One chapter tells
us all we know about him. One short sight of his career is all we
have. He bursts in upon the scene and then disappears.</p>
<h2>THE EASTERN FEAST.</h2>
<p class="pn">We are told that he made a great feast to a
thousand of his lords, and drank wine before them. In those days
a feast would sometimes last for six months in Eastern countries.
How long this feast had been going on we are not told, but in the
midst of it, he &ldquo;commanded to bring the golden and silver
vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the
temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes,
his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein. Then they
brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of
the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his
princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. They drank
wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of
iron, of wood, and of stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">While this impious act was being committed,
&ldquo;in the same hour came forth fingers of a man&rsquo;s hand,
and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the
wall of the king&rsquo;s palace; and the king saw the part of the
hand that wrote.&rdquo; We are not told at what hour of the day
or the night it happened. Perhaps it was midnight. Perhaps nearly
all the guests were more or less under the influence of drink;
but they were not so drunk but that they suddenly became sober as
they saw something that was supernatural&mdash;a handwriting on
the wall, right over the golden candlestick.</p>
<p class="pn">Every face turned deathly pale. &ldquo;The
king&rsquo;s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees
smote one against another.&rdquo; In haste he sent for his wisest
men to come and read that handwriting on the wall. They came in
one after another, and tried to make it out; but they could not
interpret it. The king promised that whoever could read it should
be made the third ruler in the kingdom; that he should have
gifts, and that a gold chain should be put round his neck. But
the wise men tried in vain. The king was greatly troubled.</p>
<p class="pn">At last, in the midst of the consternation, the
queen came in, and she told the monarch, if he would only send
for one who used to interpret the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar, he
could read the writing and tell him the interpretation thereof.
So Daniel was sent for. He was very familiar with it. He knew his
Father&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;This is the writing that was written,
<i>Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin</i>. This is the interpretation of
the thing: <i>Mene</i>&mdash;God hath numbered thy kingdom and
finished it. <i>Tekel</i>&mdash;Thou art weighed in the balances,
and art found wanting. <i>Peres</i>&mdash;Thy kingdom is divided,
and given to the Medes and Persians.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">If some one had told the king an hour before that
the time had come when he must step into the balances and be
weighed, he would have laughed at the thought. But the vital hour
had come.</p>
<p class="pn">The weighing was soon over. The verdict was
announced, and the sentence carried out. &ldquo;In that night was
Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain, and Darius the Median
took the kingdom.&rdquo; Darius and his army came marching down
those streets. There was a clash of arms. Shouts of war and
victory rent the air. That night the king&rsquo;s blood mingled
with the wine of the banquet hall. Judgment came upon him
unexpectedly, suddenly: and probably ninety-nine out of every
hundred judgments come in this way. Death comes upon us
unexpectedly; it comes upon us suddenly.</p>
<p class="pn">Perhaps you say: &ldquo;I hope Mr. Moody is not
going to compare me with that heathen king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I tell you that a man who does evil in these Gospel
days is far worse than that king. We live in a land of Bibles.
You can get the New Testament for a nickel, and if you
haven&rsquo;t got a nickel you can get it for nothing. Many
societies will be glad to give it to you free. We live in the
full blaze of Calvary. We live on this side of the cross, but
Belshazzar lived more than five hundred years on the other side.
He never heard of Jesus Christ. He never heard about the Son of
God. He never heard about God except, perhaps, in connection with
his father&rsquo;s remarkable vision. He probably had no portion
of the Bible, and if he had, probably he didn&rsquo;t believe it.
He had no godly minister to point him to the Lamb of God.</p>
<p class="pns">Don&rsquo;t tell me that you are better than that
king. I believe that he will rise in judgment and condemn many of
us.</p>
<p class="pn">All this happened long centuries ago. Let us get
down to this century, to this year, to ourselves. We will come to
the present time. Let us imagine that now, while I am preaching,
down come some balances from the throne of God. They are fastened
to the very throne itself. It is a throne of equity, of justice.
You and I must be weighed. I venture to say this would be a very
solemn audience. There would be no trifling. There would be no
indifference. No one would be thoughtless.</p>
<p class="pn">Some people have their own balances. A great many
are making balances to be weighed in. But after all we must be
weighed in God&rsquo;s balances, the balances of the sanctuary.
It is a favorite thing with infidels to set their own standard,
to measure themselves by other people. But that will not do in
the Day of Judgment. Now we will use God&rsquo;s law as a balance
weight. When men find fault with the lives of professing
Christians, it is a tribute to the law of God.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Tekel.&rdquo; It is a very short text. It is
so short I am sure you will remember it: and that is my object,
just to get people to remember God&rsquo;s own Word.</p>
<h2>GOD&rsquo;S HANDWRITING.</h2>
<p class="pn">Let me call your attention to the fact that God
wrote on the tables of stone at Sinai as well as on the wall of
Belshazzar&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p class="pn">These are the only messages to men that God has
written with His own hand. He wrote the commandments out twice,
and spoke them aloud in the hearing of Israel.</p>
<p class="pn">If it were known that God Himself was going to
speak once again to man, what eagerness and excitement there
would be. For nearly nineteen hundred years He has been silent.
No inspired message has been added to the Bible for nearly
nineteen hundred years. How eagerly all men would listen if God
should speak once more. Yet men forget that the Bible is
God&rsquo;s own Word, and that it is as truly His message to-day
as when it was delivered of old. The law that was given at Sinai
has lost none of its solemnity. Time cannot wear out its
authority or the fact of its authorship.</p>
<p class="pn">I can imagine some one saying&mdash;&ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t be weighed by that law. I don&rsquo;t believe in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Now men may cavil as much as they like about other
parts of the Bible, but I have never met an honest man that found
fault with the Ten Commandments. Infidels may mock the Lawgiver
and reject Him who has delivered us from the curse of the law,
but they can&rsquo;t help admitting that the commandments are
right. Renan said that they are for all nations, and will remain
the commandments of God during all the centuries.</p>
<p class="pn">If God created this world, He must make some laws
to govern it. In order to make life safe we must have good laws;
there is not a country the sun shines upon that does not possess
laws. Now this is God&rsquo;s law. It has come from on high, and
infidels and skeptics have to admit that it is pure. Legislatures
nearly all over the world adopt it as the foundation of their
legal systems.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;The law of the Lord is perfect, converting
the soul: the testimony of the Lord is pure, making wise the
simple: the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart:
the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Now the question for you and me is&mdash;are we
keeping these commandments? Have we fulfilled all the
requirements of the law? If God made us, as we know He did, He
had a right to make that law; and if we don&rsquo;t use it aright
it would have been better for us if we had never had it, for it
will condemn us. We shall be found wanting. The law is all right,
but are we right?</p>
<h2>AN INFIDEL&rsquo;S TESTIMONY.</h2>
<p class="pn">It is related of a clever infidel that he sought an
acquaintance with the truths of the Bible, and began to read at
the books of Moses. He had been in the habit of sneering at the
Bible, and in order to be able to refute arguments brought by
Christian men, he made up his mind, as he knew nothing about it,
to read the Bible and get some idea of its contents. After he had
reached the Ten Commandments, he said to a friend:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;I will tell you what I <i>used</i> to think.
I supposed that Moses was the leader of a horde of banditti;
that, having a strong mind, he acquired great influence over a
superstitious people; and that on Mount Sinai he played off some
sort of fireworks to the amazement of his ignorant followers, who
imagined in their fear and superstition that the exhibition was
supernatural. I have been looking into the <i>nature</i> of that
law. I have been trying to see whether I could add anything to
it, or take anything from it, so as to make it better. Sir, I
cannot! It is perfect!</p>
<p class="pn">The first commandment directs us to make the
Creator the object of our supreme love and reverence. That is
right. If He be our Creator, Preserver, and Supreme Benefactor,
we ought to treat Him, and <i>none other</i>, as such. The second
forbids idolatry. That certainly is right. The third forbids
profanity. The fourth fixes a time for religious worship. If
there be a God, He ought surely to be worshipped. It is suitable
that there should be an outward homage significant of our inward
regard. If God be worshipped, it is proper that some <i>time</i>
should be set apart for that purpose, when all may worship Him
harmoniously, and without interruption. One day in seven is
certainly not too much, and I do not know that it is too
little.</p>
<p class="pn">The fifth commandment defines the peculiar duties
arising from family relations. Injuries to our neighbor are then
<i>classified</i> by the moral law. They are divided into
offences against life, chastity, property, and character; and I
notice that the greatest offence in each class is expressly
forbidden. Thus the greatest injury to life is murder; to
chastity, adultery; to property, theft; to character, perjury.
Now the greatest offence must include the least of the same kind.
Murder must include every injury to life; adultery every injury
to purity; and so of the rest. And the moral code is closed and
perfected by a command forbidding every improper <i>desire</i> in
regard to our neighbors.</p>
<p class="pn">I have been thinking, Where did Moses get that law?
I have read history. The Egyptians and the adjacent nations were
idolaters; so were the Greeks and Romans; and the wisest or best
Greeks or Romans never gave a code of morals like this. Where did
Moses obtain that law, which surpasses the wisdom and philosophy
of the most enlightened ages? He lived at a period comparatively
barbarous; but he has given a law in which the learning and
sagacity of all subsequent time can detect no flaw. Where did he
obtain it? He could not have soared so far above his age as to
have devised it himself. I am satisfied where he obtained it. It
came down from heaven. It has convinced me of the truth of the
religion of the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The infidel, (now an infidel no longer), remained
to his death a firm believer in the truth of Christianity.</p>
<p class="pn">We call it the &ldquo;Mosaic&rdquo; Law, but it has
been well said that the commandments did not originate with
Moses, nor were they done away with when the Mosaic Law was
fulfilled in Christ, and many of its ceremonies and regulations
abolished. We can find no trace of the existence of any lawmaking
body in those early times, no parliament or congress that built
up a system of laws. It has come down to us complete and
finished, and the only satisfactory account is that which tells
us that God Himself wrote the commandments on tables of
stone.</p>
<h2>BINDING TO-DAY.</h2>
<p class="pn">Some people seem to think we have got beyond the
commandments. What did Christ say? &ldquo;Think not that I am
come to destroy the law and the prophets; I am not come to
destroy but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and
earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from
the law, till all be fulfilled.&rdquo; The commandments of God
given to Moses in the Mount at Horeb are as binding to-day as
ever they have been since the time when they were proclaimed in
the hearing of the people. The Jews said the law was not given in
Palestine, (which belonged to Israel), but in the wilderness,
because the law was for all nations.</p>
<p class="pn">Jesus never condemned the law and the prophets, but
He did condemn those who did not obey them. Because He gave new
commandments it does not follow that He abolished the old.
Christ&rsquo;s explanation of them made them all the more
searching. In His Sermon on the Mount He carried the principles
of the commandments beyond the mere letter. He unfolded them and
showed that they embraced more, that they are positive as well as
prohibitive. The Old Testament closes with these words:
&ldquo;Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded
unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and
judgments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the
coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall
turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of
the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth
with a curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Does that look as if the law of Moses was becoming
obsolete?</p>
<p class="pn">The conviction deepens in me with the years that
the old truths of the Bible must be stated and restated in the
plainest possible language. I do not remember ever to have heard
a sermon preached on the commandments. I have an index of two
thousand five hundred sermons preached by Spurgeon, and not one
of them selects its text from the first seventeen verses of
Exodus xx. The people must be made to understand that the Ten
Commandments are still binding, and that there is a penalty
attached to their violation. We do not want a gospel of mere
sentiment. The Sermon on the Mount did not blot out the Ten
Commandments.</p>
<p class="pn">When Christ came He condensed the statement of the
law into this form: &ldquo;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and
with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.&rdquo; Paul said:
&ldquo;Love is the fulfilling of the law.&rdquo; But does this
mean that the detailed precepts of the Decalogue are superseded,
and have become back numbers? Does a father cease to give
children rules to obey because they love him? Does a nation burn
its statute books because the people have become patriotic? Not
at all. And yet people speak as if the Commandments do not hold
for Christians because they have come to love God. Paul said:
&ldquo;Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid.
Yea, we establish the law.&rdquo; It still holds good. The
commandments are necessary. So long as we obey, they do not rest
heavy upon us; but as soon as we try to break away, we find they
are like fences to keep us within bounds. Horses need bridles
even after they have been properly broken in.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;We know that the law is good if a man use it
lawfully; knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous
man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for
sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for whoremongers, for them
that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars,
for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is
contrary to sound doctrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Now, my friend, are you ready to be weighed by this
law of God? A great many people say that if they keep the
commandments, they do not need to be forgiven and saved through
Christ. But have you kept them? I will admit that if you
perfectly keep the commandments, you do not need to be saved by
Christ; but is there a man in the wide world who can truly say
that he has done this? Young lady, can you say: &ldquo;I am ready
to be weighed by the law?&rdquo; Can you, young man? Will you
step into the scales and be weighed one by one by the Ten
Commandments?</p>
<p class="pn">Now face these Ten Commandments honestly and
prayerfully. See if your life is right, and if you are treating
God fairly. God&rsquo;s statutes are just, are they not? If they
are right, let us see if we are right. Let us pray that the Holy
Ghost may search each one of us. Let us get alone with God and
read His law&mdash;read it carefully and prayerfully, and ask Him
to show us our sins and what He would have us to do.</p>
<h1><a name="I" id="I">First Commandment</a></h1>
<p class="pt2">&ldquo;T<span class="sc">hou shalt have no other
gods before me</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">M<span class="sc">y</span> friend, are you ready to
be weighed against this commandment? Have you fulfilled, or are
you willing to fulfil, all the requirements of this law? Put it
into one of the scales, and step into the other. Is your heart
set upon God alone? Have you no other God? Do you love Him above
father or mother, the wife of your bosom, your children, home or
land, wealth or pleasure?</p>
<p class="pn">If men were true to this commandment, obedience to
the remaining nine would follow naturally. It is because they are
unsound in this that they break the others.</p>
<h2>FEELING AFTER GOD.</h2>
<p class="pn">Philosophers are agreed that even the most
primitive races of mankind reach out beyond the world of matter
to a superior Being. It is as natural for man to feel after God
as it is for the ivy to feel after a support. Hunger and thirst
drive him to seek for food, and there is a hunger of the soul
that needs satisfying, too. Man does not need to be commanded to
worship, as there is not a race so high or so low in the scale of
civilization but has some kind of a god. What he needs is to be
directed aright.</p>
<p class="pn">This is what the first commandment is for. Before
we can worship intelligently, we must know what or whom to
worship. God does not leave us in ignorance. When Paul vent to
Athens, he found an altar dedicated to &ldquo;An Unknown
God,&rdquo; and he proceeded to tell of Him whom we worship. When
God gave the commandments to Moses, He commenced with a
declaration of His own character, and demanded exclusive
recognition. &ldquo;I am the Lord thy God, which have brought
thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou
shalt have no other gods before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The Rev. Dr. Dale says these words have great
significance. &ldquo;The Jews knew Jehovah as the God who had
held back the waves like a wall while they fled across the sea to
escape the vengeance of their enemies; they knew him as the God
who had sent thunder, and lightning, and hail, plagues on cattle,
and plagues on men, to punish the Egyptians and to compel them to
let the children of Israel go; they knew Him as the God whose
angel had slain the firstborn of their oppressors, and filled the
land from end to end with death, and agony, and terror. He was
the same God, so Moses and Aaron told them, who by visions and
voices, in promises and precepts, had revealed Himself long
before to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We learn what men are from
what they say and from what they do. A biography of Luther gives
a more vivid and trustworthy knowledge of the man than the most
philosophical essay on his character and creed. The story of his
imprisonment and of his journey to Worms, his Letters, his
Sermons, and his Table-Talk, are worth more than the most
elaborate speculations about him. The Jews learned what God is,
not from theological dissertations on the Divine attributes, but
from the facts of a Divine history. They knew Him for themselves
in His own acts and His own words.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Some one asked an Arab: &ldquo;How do you know that
there is a God?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do I know whether a man or a
camel passed my tent last night?&rdquo; he replied. God&rsquo;s
footprints in nature and in our own experience are the best
evidence of His existence and character.</p>
<h2>THE ISRAELITES WERE EXPOSED TO DANGER.</h2>
<p class="pn">Remember to whom this commandment was given, and we
shall see further how necessary it was. The forefathers of the
Israelites had worshipped idols, not many generations back. They
had recently been delivered out of Egypt, a land of many gods.
The Egyptians worshipped the sun, the moon, insects, animals,
etc. The ten plagues were undoubtedly meant by God to bring
confusion upon many of their sacred objects. The children of
Israel were going up to take possession of a land that was
inhabited by heathen, who also worshipped idols. There was
therefore great need of such a commandment as this. There could
be no right relationship between God and man in those days any
more than to-day, until man understood that he must recognize God
alone, and not offer Him a divided heart.</p>
<p class="pn">If He created us, He certainly ought to have our
homage. Is it not right that He should have the first and only
place in our affections?</p>
<h2>NO COMPROMISE.</h2>
<p class="pn">This is one matter in which no toleration can be
shown. Religious liberty is a good thing, within certain limits.
But it is one thing to show toleration to those who agree on
essentials, and another, to those who differ on fundamental
beliefs. They were willing to admit any god to the Roman
Pantheon. One reason why the early Christians were persecuted was
that they would not accept a place for Jesus Christ there.
Napoleon is said to have entertained the idea of having separate
temples in Paris for every known religion, so that every stranger
should have a place of worship when attracted toward that city.
Such plans are directly opposed to the Divine one. God sounded no
uncertain note in this commandment. It is plain, unmistakable,
uncompromising.</p>
<p class="pn">We may learn a lesson from the way a farmer deals
with the little shoots that spring up around the trunk of an
apple tree. They look promising, and one who has not learned
better might welcome their growth. But the farmer knows that they
will draw the life-sap from the main tree, injuring its prospects
so that it will produce inferior fruit. He therefore takes his
axe and his hoe, and cuts away these suckers. The tree then gives
a more plentiful and a finer crop.</p>
<h2>GOD&rsquo;S PRUNING-KNIFE.</h2>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo; is the pruning-knife
that God uses. From beginning to end, the Bible calls for
wholehearted allegiance to Him. There is to be no compromise with
other gods.</p>
<p class="pn">It took long years for God to impress this lesson
upon the Israelites. He called them to be a chosen nation. He
made them a peculiar people. But you will notice in Bible history
that they turned away from Him continually, and were punished
with plague, pestilence, war and famine. Their sin was not that
they renounced God altogether, but that they wanted to worship
other gods beside Him. Take the case of Solomon as an example of
the whole nation. He married heathen wives who turned away his
heart after other gods, and built high places for their idols,
and lent countenance to their worship. That was the history of
frequent turnings of the whole nation away from God, until
finally He sent them into captivity in Babylon and kept them
there for seventy years. Since then the Jews have never turned to
other gods.</p>
<p class="pn">Hasn&rsquo;t the church to contend with the same
difficulty to-day? There are very few who in their hearts do not
believe in God, but what they will not do is give Him exclusive
right of way. Missionaries tell us that they could easily get
converts if they did not require them to be baptized, thus
publicly renouncing their idols. Many a person in our land would
become a Christian if the gate was not so strait. Christianity is
too strict for them. They are not ready to promise full
allegiance to God alone. Many a professing Christian is a
stumbling-block because his worship is divided. On Sunday he
worships God; on week days God has little or no place in his
thoughts.</p>
<h2>FALSE GODS IN AMERICA TO-DAY.</h2>
<p class="pn">You don&rsquo;t have to go to heathen lands to-day
to find false gods. America is full of them. Whatever you make
most of is your god. Whatever you love more than God is your
idol. Many a mans heart is like some Kaffirs&rsquo; huts, so full
of idols that there is hardly room to turn around. Rich and poor,
learned and unlearned, all classes of men and women are guilty of
this sin. &ldquo;The mean man boweth down, and the great man
humbled himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">A man may make a god of himself, of a child, of a
mother, of some precious gift that God has bestowed upon him. He
may forget the Giver, and let his heart go out in adoration
toward the gift.</p>
<p class="pn">Many make a god of pleasure; that is what their
hearts are set on. If some old Greek or Roman came to life again
and saw men in a drunken debauch, would he believe that the
worship of Bacchus had died out? If he saw the streets of our
large cities filled with harlots, would he believe that the
worship of Venus had ceased?</p>
<p class="pn">Others take fashion as their god. They give their
time and thought to dress. They fear what others will think of
them. Do not let us flatter ourselves that all idolaters are in
heathen countries.</p>
<p class="pn">With many it is the god of money. We haven&rsquo;t
got through worshipping the golden calf yet. If a man will sell
his principles for gold, isn&rsquo;t he making it a god? If he
trusts in his wealth to keep him from want and to supply his
needs, are not riches his god? Many a man says, &ldquo;Give me
money, and I will give you heaven. What care I for all the
glories and treasures of heaven? Give me treasures here! I
don&rsquo;t care for heaven! I want to be a successful business
man.&rdquo; How true are the words of Job: &ldquo;If I have made
gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my
confidence; if I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and
because mine hand had begotten much; if I beheld the sun when it
shined, or the moon walking in brightness; and my heart hath been
secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: this also were
an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied
the God that is above.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">But all false gods are not as gross as these. There
is <i>the atheist</i>. He says that he does not believe in God;
he denies His existence, but he can&rsquo;t help setting up some
other god in His place. Voltaire said, &ldquo;If there were no
God, it would be necessary to invent one.&rdquo; So the atheist
speaks of the Great Unknown, the First Cause, the Infinite Mind,
etc. Then there is <i>the deist</i>. He is a man who believes in
one God who caused all things: but he doesn&rsquo;t believe in
revelation. He only accepts such truths as can be discovered by
reason. He doesn&rsquo;t believe in Jesus Christ, or in the
inspiration of the Bible. Then there is <i>the pantheist</i>, who
says: &ldquo;I believe that the whole universe is God. He is in
the air, the water, the sun, the stars.&rdquo;; the liar and the
thief included.</p>
<h2>MOSES&rsquo; FAREWELL MESSAGE.</h2>
<p class="pn">Let me call your attention to a verse in the
thirty-second chapter of Deuteronomy, thirty-first verse:
&ldquo;For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies
themselves being judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">These words were uttered by Moses, in his farewell
address to Israel. He had been with them forty years. He was
their leader and instructor. All the blessings of heaven came to
them through him. And now the old man is about to leave them. If
you have never read his speech, do so. It is one of the best
sermons in print. I know few sermons in the Old or New Testament
that compare with it.</p>
<p class="pn">I can see Moses as he delivers this address. His
natural activity has not abated. He still has the vigor of youth.
His long white hair flows over his shoulders, and his venerable
beard covers his breast. He throws down the challenge:
&ldquo;Their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
being judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Has the human heart ever been satisfied with these
false gods? Can pleasure or riches fill the soul that is empty of
God? How about the atheist, the deist, the pantheist? What do
they look forward to? Nothing! Man&rsquo;s life is full of
trouble; but when the billows of affliction and disappointment
are rising and rolling over them, they have no God to call upon.
&ldquo;They shall cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense;
but they shall not save them at all in the time of their
trouble.&rdquo; Therefore I contend &ldquo;their rock is not as
our Rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">My friends, when the hour of affliction comes, they
call in a minister to give consolation. When I was settled in
Chicago, I used to be called out to attend many funerals. I would
inquire what the man was in his belief. If I found out he was an
atheist, or a deist, or a pantheist, when I went to the funeral
and in the presence of his friends said one word about that
man&rsquo;s doctrine, they would feel insulted. Why is it that in
a trying hour, when they have been talking all the time against
God&mdash;why is it that in the darkness of affliction they call
in believers in that God to administer consolation? Why
doesn&rsquo;t the atheist preach no hereafter, no heaven, no God,
in the hour of affliction? This very fact is an admission that
&ldquo;their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
being judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The deist says there is no use in praying, because
nothing can change the decrees of deity; God never answers
prayer. Is his rock as our Rock?</p>
<p class="pn">The Bible is true. There is only one God. How many
men have said to me: &ldquo;Mr. Moody, I would give the world if
I had your faith, your consolation, the hope you have with your
religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Isn&rsquo;t that a proof that their rock is not as
our Rock?</p>
<p class="pn">Some years ago I went into a man&rsquo;s house, and
when I commenced to talk about religion he turned to his daughter
and said: &ldquo;You had better leave the room. I want to say a
few words to Mr. Moody.&rdquo; When she had gone, he opened a
perfect torrent of infidelity upon me. &ldquo;Why did you send
your daughter out of the room before you said this?&rdquo; I
asked. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I did not think it
would do her any good to hear what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Is his rock as our Rock? Would he have sent his
daughter out if he really believed what he said?</p>
<h2>NO CONSOLATION EXCEPT IN GOD.</h2>
<p class="pn">No. There is no satisfaction for the soul except in
the God of the Bible. We come back to Paul&rsquo;s words, and get
consolation for time and eternity:&mdash;&ldquo;We know that an
idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God
but one. For though there be that are called gods, whether in
heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) yet
to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things,
and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,
and we by Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">My friend, can you say that sincerely? Is all your
hope centred on God in Christ? Are you trusting Him alone? Are
you ready to step into the scales and be weighed against this
first commandment?</p>
<h2>WHOLE-HEARTED ALLEGIANCE.</h2>
<p class="pn">God will not accept a divided heart. He must be
absolute monarch. There is not room in your heart for two
thrones. Christ said: &ldquo;No man can serve two masters; for
either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will
hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and
Mammon.&rdquo; Mark you, He did not say&mdash;&ldquo;No man
<i>shall</i> serve. . . . Ye <i>shall</i> not serve. . .
.&rdquo;, but &ldquo;No man <i>can</i> serve. . . . Ye <i>can</i>
not serve. . . .&rdquo; That means more than a command; it means
that you cannot mix the worship of the true God with the worship
of another god any more than you can mix oil and water. It cannot
be done. There is not room for any other throne in the heart if
Christ is there. If worldliness should come in, godliness would
go out.</p>
<p class="pn">The road to heaven and the road to hell lead in
different directions. Which master will you choose to follow? Be
an out-and-out Christian. &ldquo;Him only shalt thou
serve.&rdquo; Only thus can you be well pleasing to God. The Jews
were punished with seventy years of captivity because they
worshipped false gods. They have suffered nearly nineteen hundred
years because they rejected the Messiah. Will you incur
God&rsquo;s displeasure by rejecting Christ too? He died to save
you. Trust him with your whole heart, for with the heart man
believeth unto righteousness.</p>
<p class="pn">I believe that when Christ has the first place in
our hearts&mdash;when the kingdom of God is first in
everything&mdash;we shall have power, and we shall not have power
until we give Him His rightful place. If we let some false god
come in and steal our love away from the God of heaven, we shall
have no peace or power.</p>
<h1><a name="II" id="II">Second Commandment</a></h1>
<p class="pt1">&ldquo;T<span class="sc">hou shalt not make unto
thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in
heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the
water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them,
nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous</span> God,
<span class="sc">visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate
Me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me, and
keep My commandments</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">T<span class="sc">he</span> first commandment,
which we have just considered, points out the one true object of
worship; this commandment is to tell us the right way in which to
worship. The former commands us to worship God alone; this calls
for purity and spirituality as we approach Him. The former
condemns the worship of false gods; this prohibits false forms.
It relates more especially to outward acts of worship; but these
are only the expression of what is in the heart.</p>
<p class="pn">Perhaps you will say that there is no trouble about
this weight. We might go off to other ages or other lands, and
find people who make images and bow down to them; but we have
none here. Let us see if this is true. Let us step into the
scales and see if we can turn them when weighed against this
commandment.</p>
<p class="pn">I believe this is where the battle is fought. Satan
tries to keep us from worshipping God aright, and from making Him
first in everything. If I let some image made by man get into my
heart and take the place of God the Creator, it is a sin. I
believe that Satan is willing to have us worship anything,
however sacred,&mdash;the Bible, the crucifix, the
church,&mdash;if only we do not worship God Himself.</p>
<p class="pn">You cannot find a place in the Bible where a man
has been allowed to bow down and worship any one but the God of
heaven and Jesus Christ His Son. In the Book of Revelation, when
an angel came down to John, he was about to fall down and worship
him, but the angel would not let him. If an angel from heaven is
not to be worshipped, when you find people bowing down to
pictures, to images, even when they bow down to worship the
cross, <i>it is a sin</i>. There are a great many who seem to be
carried away with these things. &ldquo;Thou shalt have no other
gods before Me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou shalt not bow down thyself to
any graven image.&rdquo; God wants us to worship Him only, and if
we do not believe that Jesus Christ is God manifest in the flesh
we should not worship Him. I have no more doubt about the
divinity of Christ than I have that I exist.</p>
<p class="pn">Worship involves two things: the internal belief,
and the external act. We transgress in our hearts by having a
wrong conception of God and of Jesus Christ before ever we give
public expression in action. As some one has said, it is wrong to
have loose opinions as well as to be guilty of loose practices.
That is what Paul meant when he said: &ldquo;We ought not to
<i>think</i> that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver or
stone, graven by art or man&rsquo;s device.&rdquo; The opinions
that some people hold about Christ are not in accordance with the
Bible, and are real violations of this second commandment.</p>
<h2>A QUESTION.</h2>
<p class="pn">The question at once arises&mdash;is this
commandment intended to forbid the use of drawings and pictures
of created things altogether? Some contend that it does. They
point to the Jews and the Mohammedans as a proof. The Jews have
never been much given to art. The Mohammedans to this day do not
use designs of animals, etc., in patterns. But I do not agree
with them. I think God only meant to forbid images and other
representations when these were intended to be used as objects of
religious veneration. &ldquo;Thou shalt not make <i>unto
thee</i>. . . . Thou shalt not <i>bow down thyself</i> to them,
nor <i>serve</i> them.&rdquo; In Exodus we are told that God
ordered the bowls of the golden candlestick for the tabernacle to
be made &ldquo;like unto almonds, with a knop and a
flower;&rdquo; and the robe of the ephod had a hem on which they
were to put a bell and a pomegranate alternately. How could God
order something that broke this second commandment?</p>
<p class="pn">I believe that this commandment is a call for
spiritual worship. It is in line with Christ&rsquo;s declaration
to that Samaritan woman&mdash;&ldquo;God is a spirit, and they
that worship Him must worship Him in <i>spirit</i> and in
<i>truth</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">This is precisely what is difficult for men to do.
The apostles were hardly in their graves before they began to put
up images of them, and to worship relics. People have a desire
for something tangible, something that they can see. It is so
much easier to live in the sense than in the spirit. That is why
there is a demand for ritualism. Some people are born Puritans;
they want a simple form of worship. Others think they cannot get
along without forms and ceremonies that appeal to the senses. And
many a one whose heart is not sincere before God takes refuge in
these forms, and eases his conscience by making an outward show
of religion.</p>
<p class="pn">The second commandment is to restrain this desire
and tendency.</p>
<p class="pn">God is grieved when we are untrue to Him. God is
Love, and He is wounded when our affections are transferred to
anything else. The penalty attached to this commandment teaches
us that man has to reap what he sows, whether good or bad; and
not only that, but his children have to reap with him. Notice
that punishment is visited upon the children unto the
<i>third</i> or the <i>fourth</i> generation, while mercy is
shown unto thousands, or (as it is more correctly) unto the
<i>thousandth</i> generation.</p>
<h2>THE FOLLY OF IMAGES.</h2>
<p class="pn">Think for a moment, and you will see how idle it is
to try to make any representation of God. Christians have tried
to paint the Trinity, but how can you depict the Invisible? Can
you draw a picture of your own soul or spirit or will? Moses
impressed it upon Israel that when God spake to them out of the
midst of the fire they saw no manner of similitude, but only
heard His voice.</p>
<p class="pn">A picture or image of God must degrade our
conception of Him. It fastens us down to one idea, whereas we
ought to grow in grace and in knowledge. It makes God finite. It
brings him down to our level. It has given rise to the horrible
idols of India and China, because they fashion these images
according to their own notions. How would the president feel if
Americans made such hideous objects to resemble him as they make
of their gods in heathen countries? Isaiah bore down with
tremendous irony upon the folly of idol makers: upon the smith
who fashioned gods with tongs and hammers; and upon the carpenter
who took a tree, and used part of it for a fire to warm himself
and roast his meat, and made part of it in the figure of a man
with his rule and plane and compass, and called it his god and
worshipped it. &ldquo;A deceived heart hath turned him
aside.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">A man must be greater than anything he is able to
make or manufacture. What folly then to think of worshipping such
things!</p>
<p class="pn">The tendency of the human heart to represent God by
something that appeals to the senses is the origin of all
idolatry. It leads directly to image-worship. At first there may
be no desire to worship the thing itself, but it inevitably ends
in that. As Dr. MacLaren says: &ldquo;Enlisting the senses as
allies of the spirit is risky work. They are apt to fight for
their own band when they once begin, and the history of all
symbolical and ceremonial worship shows that the experiment is
much more likely to end in sensualizing religion than in
spiritualizing sense.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>PICTURES AND IMAGES.</h2>
<p class="pn">But some one says&mdash;&ldquo;I find pictures are
a great help to me, and images. I know that they are not
themselves sacred, but they help me in my devotions to fix my
thoughts on God.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">When Dr. Trumbull was in Northfield, he used an
illustration that is a good answer to this. He said,
&ldquo;Suppose a young man were watching from a window for his
absent mother&rsquo;s return, with a wish to catch the first
glimpse of her approaching face. Would he be wise or foolish in
putting up a photograph of her on the window-frame before him, as
a help to bear her in as he looks for her coming? As there can be
no doubt about the answer to that question, so there can be no
doubt that we can best come into communion with God by closing
our eyes to everything that can be seen with the natural eye, and
opening the eyes of our spirit to the sight of God the
Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I would a great deal sooner have five minutes
communion with Christ than spend years before pictures and images
of Him. Whatever comes between my soul and my Maker is not a help
to me, but a hindrance. God has given different means of grace by
which we can approach Him. Let us use these, and not seek for
other things that He has distinctly forbidden.</p>
<p class="pn">Dr. Dale says that in his college days he had an
engraving of our Lord hanging over his mantlepiece. &ldquo;The
calmness, the dignity, the gentleness, and the sadness of the
face represented the highest conceptions which I had in those
days of the human presence of Christ. I often looked at it, and
seldom without being touched by it. I discovered in the course of
a few mouths that the superstitious sentiments were gradually
clustering about it, which are always created by the visible
representations of the Divine. The engraving was becoming to me
the shrine of God manifest in the flesh, and I understood the
growth of idolatry. The visible symbol is at first a symbol and
nothing more; it assists thought; it stirs passion. At last it is
identified with the God whom it represents. If, every day, I bow
before a crucifix in prayer, if I address it as though it were
Christ, though I know it is not, I shall come to feel for it a
reverence and love which are of the very essence of
idolatry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Did you ever stop to think that the world has not a
single picture of Christ that has been handed down to us from His
disciples? Who knows what He was like? The Bible does not tell us
how He looked, except in one or two isolated general expressions
as when it says&mdash;&ldquo;His visage was so marred more than
any man, and His form more than the sons of men.&rdquo; We
don&rsquo;t know anything definite about His features, the color
of His hair and eyes, and the other details that would help to
give a true representation. What artist can tell us? He left no
keepsakes to His disciples. His clothes were seized by the Roman
soldiers who crucified Him. Not a solitary thing was left to be
handed down among His followers. Doesn&rsquo;t it look as if
Christ left no relics lest they should be held sacred and
worshipped?</p>
<p class="pn">History tells us further that the early Christians
shrank from making pictures and statues of any kind of Christ.
They knew Him as they had seen Him after His resurrection, and
had promises of His continued presence that pictures could not
make any more real.</p>
<p class="pn">I have seen very few pictures of Christ that do not
repel me more or less. I sometimes think that it is wrong to have
pictures of Him at all.</p>
<p class="pn">Speaking of the crucifix Dr. Dale says; &ldquo;It
makes our worship and prayer unreal. We are adoring a Christ who
does not exist. He is not on the cross now, but on the throne.
His agonies are passed forever. He has risen from the dead. He is
at the right hand of God. If we pray to a dying Christ, we are
praying not to Christ Himself, but to a mere remembrance of Him.
The injury which the crucifix has inflicted on the religious life
of Christendom, in encouraging a morbid and unreal devotion, is
absolutely incalculable. It has given us a dying Christ instead
of a living Christ, a Christ separated from us by many centuries
instead of a Christ nigh at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THE INDWELLING CHRIST.</h2>
<p class="pn">No one can say that we have nowadays any need of
such things. &ldquo;Behold I stand at the door, and knock: if any
man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and
will sup with him, and he with me.&rdquo; If Christ is in our
hearts, why need we set Him before our eyes? &ldquo;Where two or
three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them.&rdquo; If we take hold of that promise by faith, what
need is there of outward symbols and reminders? If the King
Himself is present, why need we bow down before statues supposed
to represent Him? To fill His place with an image (some one has
said,) is like blotting the sun out of the heavens and
substituting some other light in its place. &ldquo;You cannot see
Him through chinks of ceremonialism; or through the blind eyes of
erring man; or by images graven with art and man&rsquo;s device;
or in cunningly devised fables of artificial and perverted
theology. Nay, seek Him in His own Word, in the revelation of
Himself which He gives to all who walk in His ways. So you will
be able to keep that admonition of the last word of all the New
Testament revelation: &lsquo;Little children, keep yourselves
from idols.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I believe many an earnest Christian would be found
wanting if put in the balances against this commandment.
&ldquo;Tekel&rdquo; is the sentence that would be written against
them, because their worship of God and of Christ is not pure. May
God open our eyes to the danger that is creeping more and more
into public worship throughout Christendom! Let us ever bear in
mind Christ&rsquo;s words in the fourth chapter of John&rsquo;s
gospel, which show that true spiritual worship is not a matter of
special times and special places because it is of all times and
all places:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall
neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the
Father. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true
worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for
the Father seeketh such to worship Him. God is a Spirit: and they
that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<h1><a name="III" id="III">Third Commandment</a></h1>
<p class="pt1">&ldquo;T<span class="sc">hou shalt not take the
name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him
guiltless that taketh His name in vain</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I <span class="sc">was</span> greatly amazed not
long ago in talking to a man who thought he was a Christian, to
find that once in a while, when he got angry, he would swear. I
said: &ldquo;My friend, I don&rsquo;t see how you can tear down
with one hand what you are trying to build up with the other. I
don&rsquo;t see how you can profess to be a child of God and let
those words come out of your lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">He replied: &ldquo;Mr. Moody, if you knew me you
would understand. I have a very quick temper. I inherited it from
my father and mother, and it is uncontrollable; but my swearing
comes only from the lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">When God said, &ldquo;I will not hold him guiltless
that takes My name in vain,&rdquo; He meant what He said, and I
don&rsquo;t believe any one can be a true child of God who takes
the name of God in vain. What is the grace of God for, if it is
not to give me control of my temper so that I shall not lose
control and bring down the curse of God upon myself? When a man
is born of God, God takes the &ldquo;swear&rdquo; out of him.
Make the fountain good, and the stream will be good. Let the
heart be right; then the language will be right; the whole life
will be right. But no man can serve God and keep His law until he
is born of God. There we see the necessity of the new birth.</p>
<p class="pn">To take God&rsquo;s name &ldquo;in vain&rdquo;
means either (1) lightly, without thinking, flippantly; or (2)
profanely, deceitfully.</p>
<h2>USING GOD&rsquo;S NAME IRREVERENTLY.</h2>
<p class="pn">I think it is shocking to use God&rsquo;s name with
so little reverence as is common nowadays, even among professing
Christians. We are told that the Jews held it so sacred that the
covenant name of God was never mentioned amongst them except once
a year by the high priest on the Day of Atonement, when he went
into the holy of holies. What a contrast that is to the familiar
use Christians make of it in public and private worship! We are
apt to rush into God&rsquo;s presence, and rush out again,
without any real sense of the reverence and awe that is due Him.
We forget that we are on holy ground.</p>
<p class="pn">Do you know how often the word
&ldquo;reverend&rdquo; occurs in the Bible? Only once. And what
is it used in connection with? God&rsquo;s name. Psalm cxi. 9:
&ldquo;H<span class="sc">oly and reverend is His
name</span>.&rdquo; So important did the Jewish rabbis consider
this commandment that they said the whole world trembled when it
was first proclaimed on Sinai.</p>
<h2>USING GOD&rsquo;S NAME PROFANELY.</h2>
<p class="pn">But though there is far too much of this frivolous,
familiar use of God&rsquo;s name, the commandment is broken a
great deal more by profanity. Taking the name of God in vain is
blasphemy. Is there a swearing man who reads this? What would you
do if you were put into the balances of the sanctuary, if you had
to step in opposite to this third commandment? Think a moment.
Have you been taking God&rsquo;s name in vain to-day?</p>
<p class="pn">I do not believe men would ever have been guilty of
swearing unless God had forbidden it. They do not swear by their
friends, their fathers or mothers, their wives or children. They
want to show how they despise God&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p class="pn">A great many men think there is nothing in
swearing. Bear in mind that God sees something wrong in it, and
He says He will not hold men guiltless, even though society
does.</p>
<p class="pn">I met a man sometime ago who told me he had never
sinned in his life. He was the first perfect man I had ever met.
I thought I would question him, and began to measure him by the
law. I asked him: &ldquo;Do you ever get angry?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;sometimes I do; but I have a
right to do so. It is righteous indignation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you
swear when you get angry?&rdquo; He admitted he did sometimes.
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;are you ready to meet
God?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;because I never
mean anything when I swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Suppose I steal a man&rsquo;s watch and he comes
after me.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;I stole your watch
and pawned it, but <i>I did not mean anything by it</i>. I pawned
it and spent the money, but <i>I did not mean anything by
it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">You would smile at and deride such a statement.</p>
<p class="pn">Ah, friends! You cannot trifle with God in that
way. Even if you swear without meaning it, it is forbidden by
God. Christ said: &ldquo;Every idle word that men shall speak,
they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment; for by
thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
condemned.&rdquo; You will be held accountable whether your words
are <i>idle</i> or <i>blasphemous</i>.</p>
<h2>A SENSELESS HABIT.</h2>
<p class="pn">The habit of swearing is condemned by all sensible
persons. It has been called &ldquo;the most gratuitous of all
sins,&rdquo; because no one gains by it; it is &ldquo;not only
sinful, but useless.&rdquo; An old writer said that when the
accusing angel, who records men&rsquo;s words, flies up to heaven
with an oath, he blushes as he hands it in.</p>
<p class="pn">When a man blasphemes, he shows an utter contempt
for God. I was in the army during the war, and heard men cursing
and swearing. Some godly woman would pass along the ranks looking
for her wounded son, and not an oath would be heard. They would
not swear before their mothers, or their wives, or their sisters;
they had more respect for them than they had for God!</p>
<p class="pn">Isn&rsquo;t it a terrible condemnation that
swearing held its own until it came to be recognized as a vulgar
thing, a sin against society? Men dropped it then, who never
thought of its being a sin against God.</p>
<p class="pn">There will be no swearing men in the kingdom of
God. They will have to drop that sin, and repent of it, before
they see the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2>HOW TO KEEP FROM SWEARING.</h2>
<p class="pn">Men often ask: &ldquo;How can I keep from
swearing?&rdquo; I will tell you. If God puts His love into your
heart, you will have no desire to curse Him. If you have much
regard for God, you will no more think of cursing Him than you
would think of speaking lightly or disparagingly of a mother whom
you love. But the natural man is at enmity with God, and has
utter contempt for His law. When that law is written on his
heart, there will be no trouble in obeying it.</p>
<p class="pn">When I was out west about thirty years ago, I was
preaching one day in the open air, when a man drove up in a fine
turn-out, and after listening a little while to what I was
saying, he put the whip to his fine-looking Steed, and away he
went. I never expected to see him again, but the next night he
came back, and he kept on coming regularly night after night.</p>
<p class="pn">I noticed that his forehead itched&mdash;you have
noticed people who keep putting their hands to their
foreheads?&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t want any one to see him shedding
tears&mdash;of course not! It is not a manly thing to shed tears
in a religions meeting, of course!</p>
<p class="pn">After the meeting I said to a gentleman: &ldquo;Who
is that man who drives up here every night? Is he
interested?&rdquo; &ldquo;Interested! I should think not! You
should have heard the way he talked about you today.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that is a sign he is
interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">If no man ever has anything to say against you,
your Christianity isn&rsquo;t worth much. Men said of the Master,
&ldquo;He has a devil,&rdquo; and Jesus said that if they had
called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of
his household.</p>
<p class="pn">I asked where this man lived, but my friend told me
not to go to see him, for he would only curse me. I said:
&ldquo;It takes God to curse a man; man can only bring curses on
his own head.&rdquo; I found out where he lived, and went to see
him. He was the wealthiest man within a hundred miles of that
place, and had a wife and seven beautiful children. Just as I got
to his gate I saw him coming out of the front door. I stepped up
to him and said: &ldquo;This is Mr.&mdash;, I believe?&rdquo; He
said: &ldquo;Yes, sir; that is my name.&rdquo; Then he
straightened up and asked&mdash;&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I would like to ask you a
question, if you won&rsquo;t be angry.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, what
is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am told that God has blessed you above all
men in this part of the country; that He has given you wealth, a
beautiful Christian wife, and seven lovely children. I do not
know if it is true, but I hear that all He gets in return is
cursing and blasphemy.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Come in; come
in.&rdquo; I went in. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what you
said out there is true. If any man has a fine wife I am the man,
and I have a lovely family of children, and God has been good to
me. But do you know, we had company here the other night, and I
cursed my wife at the table, and did not know it till after the
company had gone. I never felt so mean and contemptible in my
life as when my wife told me of it. She said she wanted the floor
to open and let her down out of her seat. If I have tried once, I
have tried a hundred times to stop swearing. You preachers
don&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;I know all about it; I have been a drummer.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know anything
about a business-man&rsquo;s troubles. When he is harassed and
tormented the whole time, he can&rsquo;t help swearing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he can. I know something
about it. I used to swear myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;What! You used to
swear?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;how did you stop?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
never stopped.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t swear now, do
you?&rdquo; &ldquo;No; I have not sworn for years.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How did you stop?&rdquo; &ldquo;I never stopped. It
stopped itself.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
this.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I know you
don&rsquo;t. But I came up to talk to you, so that you will never
want to swear again as long as you live.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I began to tell him about Christ in the heart; how
that would take the temptation to swear out of a man,</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how am I to get
Christ?&rdquo; &ldquo;Get right down here and tell Him what you
want.&rdquo; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was never on my
knees in my life. I have been cursing all the day, and I
don&rsquo;t know how to pray or what to pray for.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is mortifying to have to
call on God for mercy when you have never used His name except in
oaths; but He will not turn you away. Ask God to forgive you if
you want to be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Then the man got down and prayed&mdash;only a few
sentences, but thank God, it is the short prayers, after all,
which bring the quickest answers. After he prayed he got up and
said: &ldquo;What shall I do now?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Go down
to the church and tell the people there that you want to be an
out-and-out Christian.&rdquo; &ldquo;I cannot do that,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;I never go to church except to some funeral.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then it is high time for you to go for something
else,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="pn">After a while he promised to go, but did not know
what the people would say. At the next church prayer-meeting, the
man was there, and I sat right in front of him. He stood up and
put his hands on the settee, and he trembled so much that I could
feel the settee shake. He said:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;My friends, you know all about me. If God
can save a wretch like me, I want to have you pray for my
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">That was thirty odd years ago. Sometime ago I was
back in that town, and did not see him; but when I was in
California, a man asked me to take dinner with him. I told him
that I could not do so, for I had another engagement. Then he
asked if I remembered him, and told me his name.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;tell me, have you ever sworn
since that night you knelt in your drawing-room, and asked God to
forgive you?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have
never had a desire to swear since then. It was all taken
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">He was not only converted, but became an earnest,
active Christian, and all these years has been serving God. That
is what will take place when a man is born of the divine
nature.</p>
<p class="pn">Is there a swearing man ready to put this
commandment into the scales, and step in to be weighed? Suppose
you swear only once in six months or a year&mdash;suppose you
swear only once in ten years&mdash;do you think God will hold you
guiltless for that act? It shows that your heart is not clean in
God&rsquo;s sight. What are you going to do, blasphemer? Would
you not be found wanting? You would be like a feather in the
balance.</p>
<h1><a name="IV" id="IV">Fourth Commandment</a></h1>
<p class="pt1">&ldquo;R<span class="sc">emember the sabbath day,
to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work:
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it
thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter,
thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made
heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested
the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and
hallowed it</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">T<span class="sc">here</span> has been an awful
letting-down in this country regarding the sabbath during the
last twenty-five years, and many a man has been shorn of
spiritual power, like Samson, because he is not straight on this
question. Can <i>you</i> say that you observe the sabbath
properly? You may be a professed Christian: are you obeying this
commandment? Or do you neglect the house of God on the sabbath
day, and spend your time drinking and carousing in places of vice
and crime, showing contempt for God and His law? Are you ready to
step into the scales? Where were you last sabbath? How did you
spend it?</p>
<p class="pn">I honestly believe that this commandment is just as
binding to-day as it ever was. I have talked with men who have
said that it has been abrogated, but they have never been able to
point to any place in the Bible where God repealed it. When
Christ was on earth, He did nothing to set it aside; He freed it
from the traces under which the scribes and Pharisees had put it,
and gave it its true place. &ldquo;The sabbath was made for man,
not man for the sabbath.&rdquo; It is just as practicable and as
necessary for men to-day as it ever was&mdash;in fact, more than
ever, because we live in such an intense age.</p>
<p class="pn">The sabbath was binding in Eden, and it has been in
force ever since. This fourth commandment begins with the word
&ldquo;remember,&rdquo; showing that the sabbath already existed
when God wrote this law on the tables of stone at Sinai. How can
men claim that this one commandment has been done away with when
they will admit that the other nine are still binding?</p>
<p class="pn">I believe that the sabbath question to-day is a
vital one for the whole country. It is the burning question of
the present time. If you give up the sabbath the church goes; if
you give up the church the home goes; and if the home goes the
nation goes. That is the direction in which we are traveling.</p>
<p class="pn">The church of God is losing its power on account of
so many people giving up the sabbath, and using it to promote
selfishness.</p>
<h2>HOW TO OBSERVE THE SABBATH.</h2>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Sabbath&rdquo; means &ldquo;rest,&rdquo; and
the meaning of the word gives a hint as to the true way to
observe the day. God rested after creation, and ordained the
sabbath as a rest for man. He blessed it and hallowed it.
&ldquo;Remember <i>the rest-day</i> to keep it
<i>holy</i>.&rdquo; It is the day when the body may be refreshed
and strengthened after six days of labor, and the soul drawn into
closer fellowship with its Maker.</p>
<p class="pn">True observance of the sabbath may be considered
under two general heads: cessation from ordinary secular work,
and religious exercises.</p>
<h2>I.&mdash;CESSATION FROM SECULAR WORK.</h2>
<p class="pn">A man ought to turn aside from his ordinary
employment one day in seven. There are many whose occupation will
not permit them to observe Sunday, but they should observe some
other day as a sabbath. Saturday is my day of rest because I
generally preach on Sunday, and I look forward to it as a boy
does to a holiday. God knows what we need.</p>
<p class="pn">Ministers and missionaries often tell me that they
take no rest-day; they do not need it because they are in the
Lord&rsquo;s work. That is a mistake. When God was giving Moses
instructions about the building of the tabernacle, He referred
especially to the sabbath, and gave injunctions for its strict
observance; and later, when Moses was conveying the words of the
Lord to the children of Israel, he interpreted them by saying
that not even were sticks to be gathered on the sabbath to kindle
fires for smelting or other purposes. In spite of their zeal and
haste to erect the tabernacle, the workmen were to have their day
of rest. The command applies to ministers and others engaged in
Christian work to-day as much as to those Israelite workmen of
old.</p>
<h2>WORKS OF NECESSITY AND OF EMERGENCY.</h2>
<p class="pn">In judging whether any work may or may not be
lawfully done on the sabbath, find out the reason and object for
doing it. Exceptions are to be made for works of necessity and
works of emergency. By &rdquo;<i>works of necessity</i>&rdquo; I
mean those acts that Christ justified when He approved of leading
one&rsquo;s ox or ass to water. Watchmen, police, stokers on
board steamers, and many others have engagements that necessitate
their working on the sabbath. By &rdquo;<i>works of
emergency</i>&rdquo; I mean those referred to by Christ when He
approved of pulling an ox or an ass out of a pit on the sabbath
day. In case of fire or sickness a man is often called on to do
things that would not otherwise be justifiable.</p>
<p class="pn">A Christian man was once urged by his employer to
work on Sunday. &ldquo;Does not your Bible say that if your ass
falls into a pit on the sabbath, you may pull him out?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;but if the ass had
the habit of falling into the same pit every sabbath, I would
either fill up the pit or sell the ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Every man must settle the question as it effects
unnecessary work, with his own conscience.</p>
<p class="pn">No man should make another work seven days in the
week. One day is demanded for rest. A man who has to work the
seven days has nothing to look forward to, and life becomes
humdrum. Many Christians are guilty in this respect.</p>
<h2>SABBATH TRAVELING.</h2>
<p class="pn">Take, for instance, the question of sabbath
traveling. I believe we are breaking God&rsquo;s laws by using
the cars on Sunday and depriving conductors and others of their
sabbath. Remember the fourth commandment expressly refers to
&ldquo;the stranger that is within thy gates.&rdquo;
Doesn&rsquo;t that touch sabbath travel?</p>
<p class="pn">But you ask, &ldquo;What are we to do? How are we
to get to church?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I reply, on foot. It will be better for you. Once
when I was holding meetings in London, in my ignorance I made
arrangements to preach four times in different places one
sabbath. After I had made the appointments I found I had to walk
sixteen miles; but I walked it, and I slept that night with a
clear conscience. I have made it a rule never to use the cars,
and if I have a private carriage, I insist that horse and man
shall rest on Monday. I want no hackman to rise up in judgment
against me.</p>
<p class="pn">My friends, if we want to help the sabbath, let
business men and Christians never patronize cars on the sabbath.
I would hate to own stock in those companies, to be the means of
taking the sabbath from these men, and have to answer for it at
the day of judgment. Let those who are Christians at any rate
endeavor to keep a conscience void of offence on this point.</p>
<h2>SABBATH TRADING.</h2>
<p class="pn">There are many who are inclined to use the sabbath
in order to make money faster. This is no new sin. The prophet
Amos hurled his invectives against oppressors who said,
&ldquo;When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and
the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Covetous men have always chafed under the
restraint, but not until the present time do we find that they
have openly counted on sabbath trade to make money. We are told
that many street car companies would not pay if it were not for
the sabbath traffic, and the sabbath edition of newspapers is
also counted upon as the most profitable.</p>
<p class="pn">The railroad men of this country are breaking down
with softening of the brain, and die at the age of fifty or
sixty. They think their business is so important that they must
run their trains seven days in the week. Business men travel on
the sabbath so as to be on hand for business Monday morning. But
if they do so God will not prosper them.</p>
<p class="pn">Work is good for man and is commanded, &ldquo;Six
days shalt thou labor;&rdquo; but overwork and work on the
sabbath takes away the best thing he has.</p>
<h2>NECESSARY AND BENEFICIAL.</h2>
<p class="pn">The good effect on a nation&rsquo;s health and
happiness produced by the return of the sabbath, with its
cessation from work, cannot be overestimated. It is needed to
repair and restore the body after six days of work. It is proved
that a man can do more in six days than in seven. Lord
Beaconsfield. said: &ldquo;Of all divine institutions, the most
divine is that which secures a day of rest for man. I hold it to
be the most valuable blessing conceded to man. It is the
corner-stone of all civilization, and its removal might affect
even the health of the people.&rdquo; Mr. Gladstone recently told
a friend that the secret of his long life is that amid all the
pressure of public cares he never forgot the sabbath, with its
rest for the body and the soul. The constitution of the United
States protects the president in his weekly day of rest. He has
ten days, &ldquo;Sundays excepted,&rdquo; in which to consider a
bill that has been sent to him for signature. Every workingman in
the republic ought to be as thoroughly protected as the
president. If workingmen got up a strike against unnecessary work
on the sabbath, they would have the sympathy of a good many.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Our bodies are seven-day clocks,&rdquo; says
Talmage, &ldquo;and they need to be wound up, and if they are not
wound up they run down into the grave. No man can continuously
break the sabbath and keep his physical and mental health. Ask
aged men, and they will tell you they never knew men who
continuously broke the sabbath, who did not fail in mind, body,
or moral principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">All that has been said about rest for man is true
for working animals. God didn&rsquo;t forget them in this
commandment, and man should not forget them either.</p>
<h2>II.&mdash;RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY.</h2>
<p class="pn">But &ldquo;rest&rdquo; does not mean idleness. No
man enjoys idleness for any length of time. When one goes on a
vacation, one does not lie around doing nothing all the time.
Hard work at tennis, hunting, and other pursuits fills the hours.
A healthy mind must find something to do.</p>
<p class="pn">Hence the sabbath rest does not mean inactivity.
&ldquo;Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to
do.&rdquo; The best way to keep off bad thoughts and to avoid
temptation is to engage in active religious exercises.</p>
<p class="pn">As regards these, we should avoid extremes. On the
one hand we find a rigor in sabbath observance that is nowhere
commanded in Scripture, and that reminds one of the formalism of
the Pharisees more than of the spirit of the gospel. Such
strictness does more harm than good. It repels people and makes
the sabbath a burden. On the other hand we should jealously guard
against a loose way of keeping the sabbath. Already in many
cities it is profaned openly.</p>
<p class="pn">When I was a boy the sabbath lasted from sundown on
Saturday to sundown on Sunday, and I remember how we boys used to
shout when it was over. It was the worst day in the week to us. I
believe it can be made the brightest day in the week. Every child
ought to be reared so that he shall be able to say, with a
friend, that he would rather have the other six days weeded out
of his memory than the sabbath of his childhood.</p>
<h2>PUBLIC WORSHIP.</h2>
<p class="pn">Make the sabbath a day of religious activity. First
of all, of course, is attendance at public worship. &ldquo;There
is a discrepancy,&rdquo; says John McNeill, &ldquo;between our
creed about the sabbath day and our actual conduct. In many
families, at ten o&rsquo;clock on the sabbath, attendance at
church is still an open question. There is no open question on
Monday morning&mdash;&lsquo;John, will you go to work
to-day?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">A minister rebuked a farmer for not attending
church, and said, &ldquo;You know John you are never absent from
market.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;O,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;we
<i>must</i> go to market.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Some one has said that without the sabbath the
church of Christ could not, as a visible organization, exist on
earth. Another has said that &ldquo;we need to be in the drill of
observance as well as in the liberty of faith.&rdquo; Human
nature is so treacherous that we are apt to omit things
altogether unless there is some special reason for doing them. A
man is not likely to worship at all unless he has regularly
appointed times and means for worship. Family and private
devotions are almost certain to be omitted altogether unless one
gets into the habit, and has a special time set apart daily.</p>
<h2>A REMINISCENCE.</h2>
<p class="pn">I remember blaming my mother for sending me to
church on the sabbath. On one occasion the preacher had to send
some one into the gallery to wake me up. I thought it was hard to
have to work in the field all the week, and then to be obliged to
go to church and hear a sermon I didn&rsquo;t understand. I
thought I wouldn&rsquo;t go to church any more when I got away
from home; but I had got so in the habit of going that I
couldn&rsquo;t stay away. After one or two sabbaths, back again
to the house of God I went. There I first found Christ, and I
have often said since,</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Mother, I thank you for making me go to the
house of God when I didn&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Parents, if you want your children to grow up and
honor you, have them honor the sabbath day. Don&rsquo;t let them
go off fishing, and getting into bad company, or it won&rsquo;t
be long before they will come home and curse you. I know few
things more beautiful than to see a father and mother coming up
the aisle with their daughters and sons, and sitting down
together to hear the Word of God. It is a good thing to have the
children, not in some remote loft or gallery, but in a good
place, well in sight. Though they cannot understand the sermon
now, when they get older they won&rsquo;t desire to break away,
they will continue attending public worship in the house of
God.</p>
<p class="pn">But we must not mistake the means for the end. We
must not think that the sabbath is just for the sake of being
able to attend meetings. There are some people who think they
must spend the whole day at meetings or private devotions. The
result is that at nightfall they are tired out, and the day has
brought them no rest. The number of church services attended
ought to be measured by the person&rsquo;s ability to enjoy them
and get good from them, without being wearied. Attending meetings
is not the only way to observe the sabbath. The Israelites were
commanded to keep it in their dwellings as well as in holy
convocation. The home, that centre of so great influence over the
life and character of the people, ought to be made the scene of
true sabbath observance.</p>
<h2>HOME OBSERVANCE.</h2>
<p class="pn">Jeremiah classified godless families with the
heathen: &ldquo;Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee
not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they
have eaten up Jacob, devoured him, and consumed him, and have
made his habitation desolate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Many mothers have written to me at one time or
another to know what to do to entertain their children on the
sabbath. The boys say, &ldquo;I do wish &rsquo;twas Night,&rdquo;
or, &ldquo;I do hate the sabbath,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I do wish the
sabbath was over.&rdquo; It ought to be the happiest day in the
week to them, one to be looked forward to with pleasure. In order
to this end, many suggestions might be followed. Make family
prayers especially attractive by having the children learn some
verse or story from the Bible. Give more time to your children
than you can give on week days, reading to them and perhaps
taking them to walk in the afternoon or evening. Show by your
conduct that the sabbath is a delight, and they will soon catch
your spirit. Set aside some time for religious instruction,
without making this a task. You can make it interesting for the
children by telling Bible stories and asking them to guess the
names of the characters. Have Sunday games for the younger
children. Picture books, puzzle maps of Palestine, etc., can be
easily obtained. Sunday albums and Sunday clocks are other
devices. Set aside attractive books for the sabbath, not letting
the children have these during the week. By doing this, the
children can be brought to look forward to the day with eagerness
and pleasure.</p>
<h2>PRIVATE OBSERVANCE.</h2>
<p class="pn">Apart from public and family observance, the
individual ought to devote a portion of the time to his own
edification. Prayer, meditation, reading, ought not to be
forgotten. Think of men devoting six days a week to their body,
which will soon pass away, and begrudging one day to the soul
which will live on and on forever: Is it too much for God to ask
for one day to be devoted to the growth and training of the
spiritual senses, when the other senses are kept busy the other
six days?</p>
<p class="pn">If your circumstances permit, engage in some
definite Christian work&mdash;such as teaching in Sunder school,
or visiting the sick. Do all the good you can Sin keeps no
sabbath, and no more should good deeds. There is plenty of
opportunity in this fallen world to perform works of mercy and
religion. Make your sabbath down here a foretaste of the eternal
sabbath that is in store for believers.</p>
<p class="pn">You want power in your Christian life, do you? You
want Holy Ghost power? You want the dew of heaven on your brow?
You want to see men convicted and converted? I don&rsquo;t
believe we shall ever have genuine conversions until we get
straight on this law of God.</p>
<h2>SABBATH DESECRATION.</h2>
<p class="pn">Men seem to think they have a right to change the
holy day into a <i>holiday</i>. The young have more temptations
to break the sabbath than we had forty years ago. There are three
great temptations: first, the trolley car, that will take you off
into the country for a nickel to have a day of recreation;
second, the bicycle, which is leading a good many Christian men
to give up their sabbath and spend the day on excursions; and the
third, the Sunday newspaper.</p>
<p class="pn">Twenty years ago Christian people in Chicago would
have been horrified if any one had prophesied that all the
theatres would be open every sabbath; but that is what has come
to pass. If it had been prophesied twenty years ago that
Christian men would take a wheel and go off on Sunday morning and
be gone all day on an excursion, Christians would have been
horrified and would have said it was impossible; but that is what
is going on to-day all over the country.</p>
<h2>THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPER.</h2>
<p class="pn">With regard to the Sunday newspaper, I know all the
arguments that are brought in its favor&mdash;that the work on it
is done during the week, that it is the Monday paper that causes
Sunday work, and so on. But there are two hundred thousand
newsboys selling the paper on Sunday. Would you like to have your
boy one of them? Men are kept running trains in order to
distribute the papers. Would you like your sabbath taken away
from you? If not, then practise the Golden Rule, and don&rsquo;t
touch the papers.</p>
<p class="pn">Their contents make them unfit for reading any day,
not to say Sunday. Some New York dailies advertise Sunday
editions of sixty pages. Many dirty pieces of scandal in this and
other countries are raked up and put into them. &ldquo;Eight
pages of fun!&rdquo;&mdash;that is splendid reading for Sunday,
isn&rsquo;t it? Even when a so-called sermon is printed, it is
completely buried by the fiction and news matter. It is time that
ministers went into their pulpits and preached against Sunday
newspapers if they haven&rsquo;t done it already. Put the man in
the scales that buys and reads Sunday papers. After reading them
for two or three hours he might go and hear the best sermon in
the world, but you couldn&rsquo;t preach anything into him. His
mind is filled up with what he has read, and there is no room for
thoughts of God. I believe that the archangel Gabriel himself
could not make an impression on an audience that has its head
full of such trash. If you bored a hole into a man&rsquo;s head,
you could not inject any thoughts of God and heaven.</p>
<p class="pn">I don&rsquo;t believe that the publishers would
allow their own children to read them. Why then should they give
them to my children and to yours?</p>
<p class="pn">A merchant who advertises in Sunday papers is not
keeping the sabbath. It is a master-stroke of the devil to induce
Christian men to do this in order to make trade for Monday. But
if a man makes money, and yet his sons are ruined and his home
broken up, what has he gained?</p>
<p class="pn">Ladies buy the Sunday papers and read the
advertisements of Monday bargains to see what they can buy cheap.
Just so with their religion. They are willing to have it if it
doesn&rsquo;t cost anything.</p>
<p class="pn">If Christian men and women refused to buy them, if
Christian merchants refused to advertise in them, they would soon
die out, because that is where they get most of their
support.</p>
<p class="pn">They tell me the Sunday paper has come to stay, and
I may as well let it alone. Never! I believe it is a great evil,
and I shall fight it while I live. I never read a Sunday paper,
and wouldn&rsquo;t have one in my house. They are often sent me,
but I tear them up without reading them. I will have nothing to
do with them. They do more harm to religion than any other one
agency I know. Their whole influence is against keeping the
sabbath holy. They are an unnecessary evil. Can&rsquo;t a man
read enough news on week days without desecrating the sabbath? We
had no Sunday papers till the war came, and we got along very
well without them. They have been increasing in size and in
number ever since then, and I think they have been lowering their
tone ever since. If you believe that, help to fight them too.
Stamp them out, beginning with yourself.</p>
<h2>PUNISHMENT OR BLESSING?</h2>
<p class="pn">No nation has ever prospered that has trampled the
sabbath in the dust. Show me a nation that has done this, and I
will show you a nation that has got in it the seeds of ruin and
decay. I believe that sabbath desecration will carry a nation
down quicker than anything else. Adam brought marriage and the
sabbath with him out of Eden, and neither can be disregarded
without suffering. When the children of Israel went into the
Promised Land God told them to let their land rest every seven
years, and He would give them as much in six years as in seven.
For four hundred and ninety years they disregarded that law. But
mark you, Nebuchadnezzar came and took them off into Babylon, and
kept them seventy years in captivity, and the land had its
seventy sabbaths of rest. Seven times seventy is four hundred and
ninety. So they did not gain much by breaking this law. You can
give God His day, or He will take it.</p>
<p class="pn">On the other hand, honoring the fourth commandment
brings blessing. &ldquo;If thou turn away thy foot from the
sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the
sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt
honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own
pleasure, nor speaking thine own words (&lsquo;thine own&rsquo;
as contrasted with what God enjoins), then shalt thou delight
thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high
places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy
father, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I do not know what will become of this republic if
we give up our Christian sabbath. If Satan can break the
conscience down on one point, he can break it down on all. When I
was in France in 1867, I could not tell one day from the other.
On Sunday stores were open and buildings were erected, the same
as on other days. See how quickly that country went down. One
hundred years ago France and England stood abreast in the march
of nations. Where do they stand to-day? France undertook to wipe
out the sabbath, and has pretty nearly wiped itself out, while
England belts the globe.</p>
<h2>A FIRM STAND.</h2>
<p class="pn">We have a fighting chance to save this nation, and
what we want is men and women who have moral courage to stand up
and say:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;No, I will not touch the Sunday paper, and
all the influence I have I will throw dead against it. I will not
go away on Saturday evening if I have to travel on Sunday to get
back. I will not do unnecessary work on the sabbath. I will do
all I can to keep it holy as God commanded.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">But some one says: &ldquo;Mr. Moody, what are you
going to do? I have to work seven days a week or
starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Then starve! Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a grand thing to
have a martyr in the nineteenth century? &ldquo;The blood of the
martyrs is the seed of the church.&rdquo; Some one says the seed
is getting very low; it has been a long time since we have had
any seed. I would give something to erect a monument to such a
martyr to his fidelity to God&rsquo;s law. I would go around the
world to attend his funeral.</p>
<p class="pn">We want to-day men who will make up their minds to
do what is right, and stand by it if the heavens tumble on their
heads. What is to become of Christian Associations and Sunday
Schools, of churches and Christian Endeavor Societies, if the
Christian sabbath is given up to recreation, and made a holiday?
Hasn&rsquo;t the time come to call a halt if men want power with
God? Let men call you narrow and bigoted, but be man enough to
stand by God&rsquo;s law, and you will have power and blessing.
That is the kind of Christianity we want just now in this
country. Any man can go with the crowd, but we want men who will
go against the current.</p>
<p class="pn">Sabbath-breaker, are you ready to step into the
scales?</p>
<h1><a name="V" id="V">Fifth Commandment</a></h1>
<p class="pt1"><span class="sc">&ldquo;Honor thy father and thy
mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord
thy God giveth thee</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">W<span class="sc">e</span> are living in dark days
on this question too. It really seems as if the days the apostle
Paul wrote about are upon us: &ldquo;In the last days perilous
times shall come; for men shall be lovers of their own selves,
covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, <i>disobedient to
parents, unthankful</i>, unholy, <i>without natural
affection</i>, despisers of those that are good, . . . .&rdquo;
If Paul was alive to-day, could he have described the present
state of affairs more truly? There are perhaps more men in this
country that are breaking the hearts of their fathers and
mothers, and trampling on the law of God, than in any other
civilized country in the world. How many sons treat their parents
with contempt, and make light of their entreaties? A young man
will have the kindest care from parents; they will watch over
him, and care for all his wants; and some bad companion will come
in and sweep him away from them in a few weeks. How many young
ladies have married against their parents&rsquo; wishes, and have
gone off and made their own life bitter! I never knew one case
that did not turn out badly. They invariably bring ruin upon
themselves, unless they repent.</p>
<h2>BEGIN IN THE HOME.</h2>
<p class="pn">The first four commandments deal with our relations
to God. They tell us how to worship and when to worship; they
forbid irreverence and impiety in word and act. Now God turns to
our relations with each other, and isn&rsquo;t it significant
that He deals first with family life? &ldquo;God is going to show
us our duty to our neighbor. How does He begin? Not by telling us
how kings ought to reign, or how soldiers ought to fight, or how
merchants ought to conduct their business, but how boys and girls
ought to behave at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">We can see that if their home life is all right,
they are almost sure to fulfil the law both in regard to God and
man. Parents stand in the place of God to their children in a
great many ways until the children arrive at years of discretion.
If the children are true to their parents, it will be easier for
them to be true to God. He used the human relationship as a
symbol of our relationship to Him both by creation and by grace.
God is our Father in heaven. We are His offspring.</p>
<p class="pn">On the other hand, if they have not learned to be
obedient and respectful at home, they are likely to have little
respect for the law of the land. It is all in the heart; and the
heart is prepared at home for good or bad conduct outside. The
tree grows the way the twig is bent.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Honor thy father and thy mother.&rdquo; That
word &ldquo;honor&rdquo; means more than mere obedience&mdash;a
child may obey through fear. It means love and affection,
gratitude, respect. We are told that in the east the words
&ldquo;father&rdquo; and &ldquo;mother&rdquo; include those who
are &ldquo;superiors in age, wisdom and in civil or religious
station,&rdquo; so that when the Jews were taught to honor their
father and mother it included all who were placed over them in
these relations, as well as their parents. Isn&rsquo;t there a
crying need for that same feeling to-day? The lawlessness of the
present time is a natural consequence of the growing absence of a
feeling of respect for those in authority.</p>
<h2>HONOR THY MOTHER.</h2>
<p class="pn">It has been pointed out as worthy of notice that
this commandment enjoins honor for <i>the mother</i>, and yet in
eastern countries to the present day woman is held of little
account. When I was in Palestine a few years ago, the prettiest
girl in Jericho was sold by her father in exchange for a donkey.
In many ancient nations, just as in certain parts of heathendom
today, the parents are killed off as soon as they become old and
feeble. Can&rsquo;t we see the hand of God here, raising the
woman to her rightful position of honor out of the degradation
into which she had been dragged by heathenism?</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Honor thy father and thy mother that thy
days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth
thee.&rdquo; I believe that we must get back to the old truths.
You may make light of it, and laugh at it, young man, but
remember that God has given this commandment, and you cannot set
it aside. If we get back to this law, we shall have power and
blessing.</p>
<h2>TEMPORAL BLESSING OR CURSE.</h2>
<p class="pn">I believe it to be literally true that our temporal
condition depends on the way we act upon this commandment.
&ldquo;Honor thy father and mother, (which is the first
commandment with promise), that it may be well with thee, and
that thou mayest live long on the earth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Honor thy
father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee;
that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with
thee, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cursed is he that setteth light by his father or
mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whoso curseth his father or mother, his
lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.&rdquo; It would be
easy to multiply texts from the Bible to prove this truth.
Experience teaches the same thing. A good, loving son generally
turns out better than a refractory son. Obedience and respect at
home prepare the way for obedience to the employer, and are
joined with other virtues that help toward a prosperous career,
crowned with a ripe, honored old age. Disobedience and disrespect
for parents are often the first steps in the downward track. Many
a criminal has testified that this is the point where he first
went astray. I have lived over sixty years, and I have learned
one thing if I have learned nothing else&mdash;that no man or
woman who dishonors father or mother ever prospers.</p>
<p class="pn">Young man, young woman, how do you treat your
parents? Tell me that, and I will tell you how you are going to
get on in life. When I hear a young man speaking contemptuously
of his grey-haired father or mother, I say he has sunk very low
indeed. When I see a young man as polite as any gentleman can be
when he is out in society, but who snaps up his mother and speaks
unkindly to his father, I would not give the snap of my finger
for his religion. If there is any man or woman on earth that
ought to be treated kindly and tenderly, it is that loving mother
or that loving father. If they cannot have your regard through
life, what reward are they to have for all their care and
anxiety? Think how they loved you and provided for you in your
early days.</p>
<h2>A MOTHER&rsquo;S LOVE.</h2>
<p class="pn">Let your mind go back to the time when you were
ill. Did your mother neglect you? When a neighbor came in and
said, &ldquo;Now, mother, you go and lie down; you have been up
for a week; I will take your place for a night&rdquo;&mdash;did
she do it? No; and if the poor worn body forced her to it at
last, she lay watching, and if she heard your voice, she was at
your side directly, anticipating all your wants, wiping the
perspiration away from your brow. If you wanted water, how soon
you got it! She would gladly have taken the disease into her own
body to save you. Her love for you would drive her to any
lengths. No matter to what depths of vice and misery you have
sunk, no matter how profligate you have grown, she has not turned
you out of her heart. Perhaps she loves you all the more because
you are wayward. She would draw you back by the bands of a love
that never dies.</p>
<h2>FILIAL INGRATITUDE.</h2>
<p class="pn">When I was in England, I read of a man who
professed to be a Christian, who was brought before the
magistrate for not supporting his aged father. He had let him go
to the workhouse. My friends, I&rsquo;d rather be content with a
crust of bread and a drink of water than let my father or mother
go to the workhouse. The idea of a professing Christian doing
such a thing! God have mercy on such a godless Christianity as
that! It is a withered up thing, and the breath of heaven will
drive it away. Don&rsquo;t profess to love God and do a thing
like that.</p>
<p class="pn">A friend of mine told me of a poor man who had sent
his son to school in the city. One day the father was hauling
some wood into the city, perhaps to pay his boy&rsquo;s bills.
The young man was walking down the street with two of his school
friends, all dressed in the very height of fashion. His father
saw him, and was so glad that he left his wood, and went to the
sidewalk to speak to him. But the boy was ashamed of his father,
who had on his old working clothes, and spurned him, and
said:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Will such a young man ever amount to anything?
Never!</p>
<p class="pn">I remember a very promising young man whom I had in
the Sunday school in Chicago. His father was a confirmed
drunkard, and his mother took in washing to educate her four
children. This was her eldest son, and I thought that he was
going to redeem the whole family. But one day a thing happened
that made him go down in my estimation.</p>
<p class="pn">The boy was in the high school, and was a very
bright scholar. One day he stood with his mother at the cottage
door&mdash;it was a poor house, but she could not pay for their
schooling, and feed and clothe her children, and hire a very good
house too, out of her earnings. When they were talking a young
man from the high school came up the street, and this boy walked
away from his mother. Next day the young man said:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Who was that I saw you talking to
yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Oh, that was my washerwoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I said: &ldquo;Poor fellow! He will never amount to
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">That was a good many years ago. I have kept my eye
on him. He has gone down, down, down, and now he is just a
miserable wreck. Of course he would go down. Ashamed of his
mother that loved him and toiled for him, and bore so much
hardship for him! I cannot tell you the contempt I had for that
one act.</p>
<p class="pn">Let us look at</p>
<h2>A BRIGHTER PICTURE.</h2>
<p class="pn">Some years ago I heard of a poor woman who sent her
boy to school and college. When he was to graduate, he wrote his
mother to come, but she sent back word that she could not because
her only skirt had already been turned once. She was so shabby
that she was afraid he would be ashamed of her. He wrote back
that he didn&rsquo;t care how she was dressed, and urged so
strongly that she went. He met her at the station, and took her
to a nice place to stay. The day came for his graduation, and he
walked down the broad aisle with that poor mother dressed very
shabbily, and put her into one of the best seats in the house. To
her great surprise he was the valedictorian of the class, and he
carried everything before him. He won a prize, and when it was
given to him, he stepped down before the whole audience, and
kissed his mother, and said:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Here, mother, here is the prize. It is
yours. I would not have had it if it had not been for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Thank God for such a man!</p>
<p class="pn">The one glimpse the Bible gives us of thirty out of
the thirty-three years of Christ&rsquo;s life on earth shows that
He did not come to destroy this fifth commandment. The secret of
all those silent years is embodied in that verse in Luke&rsquo;s
Gospel&mdash;&ldquo;And He went down with them and came to
Nazareth, and was subject to them.&rdquo; Did He not set an
example of true filial love and care when in the midst of the
agonies of the cross He mode provision for His mother? Did He not
condemn the miserable evasions of this law by the Pharisees of
His own day:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites,
as it is written, This people honoreth me with their lips, but
their heart is far from me. But in vain do they worship me,
teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men. . . . Full well
do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your
tradition. For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and,
He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death;
but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That
wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me, is Corban,
(that is to say, Given to God), ye no longer suffer him to do
aught for his father or his mother: making void the word of God
by your tradition, which ye have delivered.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I have read of one heathen custom in China, which
would do us credit in this so-called Christian country. On every
New Year&rsquo;s morning each man and boy, from the emperor to
the lowest peasant, is said to pay a visit to his mother,
carrying her a present varying in value according to his station
in life. He thanks her for all she has done for him, and asks a
continuance of her favor another year. Abraham Lincoln used to
say: &ldquo;All I have I owe to my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I would rather die a hundred deaths than have my
children grow up to treat me with scorn and contempt. I would
rather have them honor me a thousand times over than have the
world honor me. I would rather have their esteem and favor than
the esteem of the whole world. And any man who seeks the honor
and esteem of the world, and doesn&rsquo;t treat his parents
right, is sure to be disappointed:</p>
<h2>AN EXHORTATION.</h2>
<p class="pn">Young man, if your parents are still living treat
them kindly. Do all you can to make their declining years sweet
and happy. Bear in mind that this is the only commandment that
you may not always be able to obey. As long as you live, you will
be able to serve God, to keep the sabbath, to obey all the other
commandments, but the day comes to most men when father and
mother die. What bitter feelings you will have when the
opportunity has gone by, if you fail to show them the respect and
love that is their due! How long is it since you wrote to your
mother? Perhaps you have not written home for months, or it may
be for years. How often I get letters from mothers urging me to
try and influence their sons!</p>
<p class="pn">Which would you rather be&mdash;a Joseph or an
Absalom? Joseph wasn&rsquo;t satisfied until he had brought his
old father down into Egypt. He was the greatest man in Egypt,
next to Pharaoh; he was arrayed in the finest garments; he had
Pharaoh&rsquo;s ring on his hand, and a gold chain about his
neck, and they cried before him, &ldquo;Bow the knee.&rdquo; Yet
when he heard Jacob was coming, he hurried out to meet him. He
wasn&rsquo;t ashamed of the old man, with his shepherds clothes.
What a contrast we see in Absalom. That young man broke his
father&rsquo;s heart by his rebellion, and the Jews are said to
throw a stone at Absalom&rsquo;s pillar to the present day,
whenever they pass it, as a token of their horror of
Absalom&rsquo;s unnatural conduct.</p>
<p class="pn">Come, now, are you ready to be weighed? If you have
been dishonoring your father and mother, step into the scales and
see how quickly you will be found wanting. See how quickly you
will strike the beam. I don&rsquo;t know any man who is much
lighter than one who treats his parents with contempt. Do you
disobey them just as much as you dare? Do you try to deceive
them? Do you call them old-fashioned, and sneer at their advice?
How do you treat that venerable father and praying mother?</p>
<p class="pn">You may be a professing Christian, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t give much for your religion unless it gets into
your life and teaches you how to live. I wouldn&rsquo;t give a
snap of my finger for a religion that doesn&rsquo;t begin at home
and regulate your conduct toward your parents.</p>
<h1><a name="VI" id="VI">Sixth Commandment</a></h1>
<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">&ldquo;Thou shalt not
kill</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I <span class="sc">used</span> to say: &ldquo;What
is the use of taking up a law like this in an audience where,
probably, there isn&rsquo;t a man who ever thought of, or ever
will commit murder?&rdquo; But as one gets on in years, he sees
many a murder that is not outright killing. I need not kill a
person to be a murderer. If I get so angry that I wish a man
dead, I am a murderer in God&rsquo;s sight. God looks at the
heart and says he that hateth his brother is a murderer.</p>
<p class="pn">First let us see what this commandment does not
mean.</p>
<p class="pn">It does not forbid the killing of animals for food
and for other reasons. Millions of rams and lambs and
turtle-doves must have been killed every year for sacrifices
under the Mosaic system. Christ Himself ate of the Passover lamb,
and we are told definitely of cases where He ate fish Himself and
provided it for His disciples and the people to eat.</p>
<p class="pn">It does not forbid the killing of burglars, etc.,
in self-defence. Directly after the giving of the Ten
Commandments, God laid down the ordinance that if a thief be
found breaking in and be smitten that he die, it was pardonable.
Did not Christ justify this idea of self-defence when He said:
&ldquo;If the goodman of the house had known in what watch the
thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have
suffered his house to be broken up?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">It does not forbid capital punishment. God Himself
set the death penalty upon violations of each of the first seven
commandments, as well as for other crimes. God said to Noah after
the deluge&mdash;&ldquo;Whoso sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood, by man
shall his blood be shed;&rdquo; and the reason given is just as
true to-day as it was then&mdash;&ldquo;for in the image of God
made He man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">What it does forbid is the wanton, intentional
taking of human life under wrong motives and circumstances. Man
is made in God&rsquo;s image. He is built for eternity. He is
more than a mere animal. His life ought therefore to be held
sacred. Once taken, it can never be restored. In heathen lands
human life is no more sacred than the life of animals; even in
Christian lands there are heartless and selfish men who hold it
cheap; but God has invested it with a high value. An infidel
philosopher of the eighteenth century said: &ldquo;In the sight
of God every event is alike important; and the life of a man is
of no greater importance to the universe than that of an
oyster.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is the crime,&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;of turning a few ounces of blood out of their
channel?&rdquo; Such language needs no answer.</p>
<h2>THE VALUE OF A MAN.</h2>
<p class="pn">Let me give you a passage from H. L. Hastings:
&ldquo;A friend of mine visited the Fiji Islands in 1844, and
what do you suppose an infidel was worth there then? You could
buy a man for a musket, or if you paid money, for seven dollars,
and after you had bought him you could feed him, starve him, work
him, whip him, or eat him&mdash;they generally ate them, unless
they were so full of tobacco they could not stomach them! But if
you go there to-day you could not buy a man for seven million
dollars. There are no men for sale there now. What has made the
difference in the price of humanity? The twelve hundred Christian
chapels scattered over that Island tell the story. The people
have learned to read that Book which says: &lsquo;Ye were not
redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold, but with the
precious blood of Christ&rsquo;; and since they learned that
lesson, no man is for sale there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Men tell me that the world is getting so much
better. We talk of our American civilization. We forget the
alarming increase of crime in our midst. It is said that there is
no civilized country on the globe where murder is so frequently
committed and so seldom punished.</p>
<h2>SUICIDE.</h2>
<p class="pn">There is that other kind of murder that is
increasing at an appalling rate among us&mdash;suicide. There
have been infidels in all ages who have advocated it as a
justifiable means of release from trial and difficulty; yet
thinking men, as far back as Aristotle, have generally condemned
it as cowardly and unjustifiable under any conditions. No man has
a right to take his own life from such motives any more than the
life of another.</p>
<p class="pn">It has been pointed out that the Jewish race, the
people of God, always counted length of days as a blessing. The
Bible does not mention one single instance of a good man
committing suicide. In the four thousand years of Old Testament
history it records only four suicides, and only one suicide in
the New Testament. Saul, king of Israel, and his armor-bearer,
Ahithophel, Zimri and Judas Iscariot are the five cases. Look at
the references in the Bible to see what kind of men they
were.</p>
<h2>OTHER KINDS OF MURDER.</h2>
<p class="pn">But I want to speak of other classes of murderers
that are very numerous in this country, although they are not
classified as murderers. The man who is the cause of the death of
another through criminal carelessness is guilty. The man who
sells diseased meat; the saloon-keeper whose drink has maddened
the brain of a criminal; those who adulterate food; the employer
who jeopardizes the lives of employees and others by unsafe
surroundings and conditions in harmful occupations,&mdash;they
are all guilty of blood where life is lost as a consequence.</p>
<p class="pn">When I was in England in 1892, I met a gentleman
who claimed that they were ahead of us in the respect they had
for the law. &ldquo;We hang our murderers,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but there isn&rsquo;t one out of twenty in your country
that is hung.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You are greatly mistaken, for
they walk about these two countries unhung.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do
you mean?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will tell you what I mean,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;the man that comes into my house and runs a dagger
into my heart for my money, is a prince compared with a son that
takes five years to kill me and the wife of my bosom. A young man
who comes home night after night drunk, and when his mother
remonstrates, curses her grey hairs and kills her by inches, is
the blackest kind of a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">That kind of thing is going on constantly all
around us. One young man at college, an only son, whose mother
wrote to him remonstrating against his gambling and drinking
habits, took the letters out of the post-office, and when he
found that they were from her, he tore them up without reading
them. She said,</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;I thought I would die when I found I had
lost my hold on that son.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">If a boy kills his mother by his conduct, you
can&rsquo;t call it anything else than <i>murder</i>, and he is
as truly guilty of breaking this sixth commandment as if he drove
a dagger to her heart. If all young men in this country who are
killing their parents and their wives by inches, should be hung
this next week, there would be a great many funerals.</p>
<p class="pn">How are you treating your parents? Come, are you
killing them? This sixth commandment follows very naturally after
the fifth,&mdash;&ldquo;Honor thy father and thy mother.&rdquo;
Don&rsquo;t put any thorns in their pillows and make their last
days miserable. Bear in mind that the commandment refers not only
to shooting a man down in cold blood; but he is the worst
murderer who goes on, month after month, year after year, until
he has crowded the life out of a sainted mother and put a godly
father under the sod.</p>
<h2>THE WORDS OF CHRIST.</h2>
<p class="pn">Let us look once again at the Sermon on the Mount,
that men think so much of, and see what Christ had to say:
&ldquo;Ye have heard that it has been said by them of old time,
Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger
of the judgment: but I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with
his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment:
and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, (an expression of
contempt), shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall
say, Thou fool, (an expression of condemnation), shall be in
danger of hell fire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Three degrees of murderous
guilt,&rdquo; as has been said, &ldquo;all of which can be
manifested without a blow being struck; secret anger&mdash;the
spiteful jeer&mdash;the open, unrestrained outburst of violent
abusive speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Again, what does John say? &ldquo;Whosoever hateth
his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath
eternal life abiding in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Did you ever in your heart wish a man dead? That
was murder. Did you ever get so angry that you wished any one
harm? Then you are guilty. I may be addressing some one who is
cultivating an unforgiving spirit. That is the spirit of the
murderer, and needs to be rooted out of your heart.</p>
<p class="pn">We can only read man&rsquo;s acts&mdash;what they
have done. God looks down into the heart. That is the birthplace
and home of the evil desires and intentions that lead to the
transgression of all God&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p class="pn">Listen once more to the words of Jesus: "From
within, out of the heart of men, proceed <span class="sc">evil
thoughts&mdash;adulteries&mdash;fornications&mdash;murders&mdash;thefts&mdash;covetousness&mdash;wickedness&mdash;deceit&mdash;lasciviousness&mdash;an
evil eye&mdash;blasphemy&mdash;pride&mdash;foolishness</span>. .
. .&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">May God purge our hearts of these evil things, if
we are harboring them! Ah, if many of us were weighed now, we
should find Belshazzar&rsquo;s doom written against
us&mdash;&ldquo;Tekel&mdash;wanting!&rdquo;</p>
<h1><a name="VII" id="VII">Seventh Commandment</a></h1>
<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">&ldquo;Thou shalt not commit
adultery.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="pn">A<span class="sc">n</span> English army-officer in
India who had been living an impure life went around one evening
to argue religion with the chaplain. During their talk the
officer said:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Religion is all very well, but you must
admit that there are difficulties&mdash;about the miracles, for
instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The chaplain knew the man and his besetting sin,
and quietly looking him in the face, answered:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Yes, there are some things in the Bible not
very plain, I admit; but the seventh commandment is very
plain.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>PLAIN SPEAKING.</h2>
<p class="pn">I would to God I could pass over this commandment,
but I feel that the time has come to cry aloud and spare not.
Plain speaking about it is not very fashionable nowadays.
&ldquo;Teachers of religion have by common consent banished from
their public teaching all advice, warning or allusion in regard
to love between the sexes,&rdquo; says Dr. Stalker. These themes
are left to poets and novelists to handle. In an autobiography
recently published in England, the writer attributed no small
share of the follies and vices of his earlier years to his never
having heard a plain, outspoken sermon on this seventh
commandment.</p>
<p class="pn">But though men are inclined to pass it by, God is
not silent or indifferent in regard to it. When I hear any one
make light of adultery and licentiousness, I take the Bible and
see how God has let his curse and wrath come down upon it.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Thou shalt not commit adultery. . . . For
this is a heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by
the judges. For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and
would root out all mine increase. . . . By means of a whorish
woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress
will hunt for the precious life. Can a man take fire in his
bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Can one go upon hot coals,
and his feet not be burned? So he that goeth in to his
neighbor&rsquo;s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be
innocent. . . . Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh
understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. A wound
and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped
away. . . . Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit
the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
mankind shall inherit the kingdom of God. . . . But fornication,
and all uncleanness, let it not be once named among you, as
becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor
jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving thanks. For
this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person hath any
inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man
deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh
the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not ye
therefore partakers with them. . . . Whoremongers shall have
their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone:
which is the second death. . . . For without are whoremongers. .
. .&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">These are a few of the threatenings and warnings
contained in the old Book, up to its closing chapter. It speaks
plainly, without compromise.</p>
<h2>MARRIAGE AND THE HOME.</h2>
<p class="pn">This commandment is God&rsquo;s bulwark around
marriage and the home. Marriage is one of the institutions that
existed in Eden; it is older than the fall. It is the most sacred
relationship that can exist between human beings, taking
precedence even of the relationship of the parent and child. Some
one has pointed out that as in the beginning God created one man
and one woman, this is the true order for all ages. Where family
ties are disregarded and dishonored, the results are always
fatal. The home existed before the church, and unless the home is
kept pure and undefiled, there can be no family religion and the
church is in danger. Adultery and licentiousness have swept
nation after nation out of existence. Did it not bring fire and
brimstone from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah? What carried Rome
into ruin? The obscene frescoes and statues at Pompeii and Naples
tell the tale. Where there is no sacredness around the home,
population dwindles; family virtues disappear; the children are
corrupt from their very birth; the seeds of sure decay are
already planted. In 1895 there were twenty-five thousand divorces
in this country. I was on one of the fashionable streets of a
prominent city some time ago, where every family except two in
the whole street had either a son or a daughter that had been
divorced. Divorce and debauchery go hand in hand. We are not
gaining much in turning away from this old law, are we?</p>
<h2>THE DEVIL&rsquo;S COUNTERFEIT.</h2>
<p class="pn">Lust is the devil&rsquo;s counterfeit of love.
There is nothing more beautiful on earth than a pure love, and
there is nothing so blighting as lust. I do not know of a
quicker, shorter way down to hell than by adultery and the
kindred sins condemned by this commandment. The Bible says that
with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, but
&ldquo;whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.&rdquo;
Lust will drive all natural affection out of a man&rsquo;s heart.
For the sake of some vile harlot he will trample on the feelings
and entreaties of a sainted mother and beautiful wife and godly
sister.</p>
<p class="pn">Young man, are you leading an impure life? Suppose
God&rsquo;s scales should drop down before you, what would you
do? Are you fit for the kingdom of heaven? You know very well
that you are not. You loathe yourself. When you look upon that
pure wife or mother, you say,</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;What a vile wretch I am! The harlot is
bringing me down to an untimely and dishonored grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">May God show us what a fearful sin it is! The idea
of making light of it! I do not know of any sin that will make a
man run down to ruin more quickly. I am appalled when I think of
what is going on in the world; of so many young men living impure
lives, and talking about the virtue of women as if it
didn&rsquo;t amount to anything. This sin is coming in upon us
like a flood at the present day. In every city there is an army
of prostitutes. Young men by hundreds are being utterly ruined by
this accursed sin.</p>
<h2>THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER.</h2>
<p class="pn">I think that the most infernal thing the sun shines
on in America is the way woman is treated after she has been
ruined by a man, often under fair promises of marriage. Some one
said that when the prodigal son came home he had the best robe
and the fatted calf, but what does the prodigal daughter get?
Although she may have been more sinned against than sinning, she
is cast out and ostracized by society. She is condemned to an
almost hopeless life of degradation and shame, sinking step by
step into a loathsome grave, unless she hurries her doom by
suicide. But the wretch who has ruined her in body and soul,
holds his head as high as ever, and society attaches no stain to
him. If he had failed to pay his gambling debts or was detected
cheating at cards, he would promptly be dropped by society; but
he may boast of his impure life, and his companions will think
nothing of it. Parents who would not allow their daughters to
become acquainted with a man who is rude in manners, sometimes do
not hesitate to accept the society of men who are known to be
impure.</p>
<p class="pn">Talk about stealing&mdash;a man who steals the
virtue of a woman is the meanest thief that ever was on the face
of the earth! One who goes into your house and steals your money
is a prince compared with a vile libertine who takes the virtue
of your sister, or steals the affection of your wife, and robs
you of her; no sneakthief that ever walked the earth is so mean
as he. How men pass laws to protect their property, but when that
which is far nearer and dearer to them than money is taken, it is
made light of! If a man should push a young lady into the river
and she should be drowned, the law would lay hold of him, and he
would be tried for murder and hung. But if he wins her affection
and ruins her, and then casts her off, isn&rsquo;t he worse, than
a murderer? There are some sins that are worse than murder, and
that is one of them. If some one should treat your wife or sister
so, you would want to shoot him as you would a dog. Why do you
not respect all women as you do your mother and sister?
&ldquo;What law of justice forgives the obscene bird of prey,
while it kicks out of its path the soiled and bleeding
dove?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>GOD&rsquo;S COMING JUDGMENT.</h2>
<p class="pn">God has appointed a day when this matter will be
set right. &ldquo;Be not deceived: God is not mocked: whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap.&rdquo; He will render to
every man according to his deeds. You may walk down the aisle of
the church and take your seat, thinking that no one knows of your
sin. But God is on the throne, and He will surely bring you to
judgment. Do you believe that God will allow this infernal thing
to go on,&mdash;women bearing all the blame while guilty men go
unpunished? God has appointed a day when He will judge this world
in righteousness, and the day is fast approaching.</p>
<p class="pn">If you are guilty of this sin, do not let the day
pass until you repent. If you are living in some secret sin, or
are fostering impure thoughts, make up your mind that by the
grace of God you will be delivered. I don&rsquo;t believe a man
who is guilty of this sin is ever going to see the kingdom of God
unless he repents in sackcloth and ashes, and does all he can to
make restitution.</p>
<h2>AN EVIL HARVEST.</h2>
<p class="pn">Even in this life adultery and uncleanness bring
their awful results, both physical and mental. The pleasure and
excitement that lead so many astray at the beginning soon pass
away, and only the evil remains. Vice carries a sting in its
tail, like the scorpion. The body is sinned against, and the body
sooner or later suffers. &ldquo;Every sin that a man doeth is
without the body: but he that committeth fornication sinneth
against his own body,&rdquo; said Paul. Nature herself punishes
with nameless diseases, and the man goes down to the grave
rotten, leaving the effects of his sin to blight his posterity.
There are nations whose manhood has been eaten out by this awful
scourge.</p>
<p class="pn">It drags a man lower than the beasts. It stains the
memory. I believe that memory is &ldquo;the worm that never
dies,&rdquo; and the memory is never cleansed of obscene stories
and unclean acts. Even if a man repents and reforms he often has
to fight the past.</p>
<p class="pn">Lust gave Samson into the power of Delilah, who
robbed him of his strength. It led David to commit murder and
called down upon him the wrath of God, and if he had not repented
he would have lost heaven. I believe that if Joseph had responded
to the enticement of Potiphar&rsquo;s wife, his light would have
gone out in darkness.</p>
<p class="pn">It ends in one or other of two ways: either in
remorse and shame because of the realization of the loss of
purity, with a terrible struggle against a hard taskmaster; or in
hardness of heart, brutalizing of the finer senses, which is a
more dreadful condition.</p>
<p class="pn">We hear a good deal about intemperance nowadays.
That sin advertises itself; it shows its marks upon the face and
in the conduct. But this hides itself away under the shadow of
the night. A man who tampers with this evil goes on step by step
until his character is blasted, his reputation ruined, his health
gone, and his life made as dark as hell. May God wake up the
nation to see how this awful sin is spreading!</p>
<p class="pn">Will any one deny that the house of the strange
woman is &ldquo;the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
death,&rdquo; as the Bible says? Are there not men whose
characters have been utterly ruined for this life through this
accursed sin? Are there not wives who would rather sink into
their graves than live? Many a man went with a pure woman to the
altar a few years ago, and promised to love and cherish her. Now
he has given his affections to some vile harlot, and brought ruin
on his wife and children!</p>
<h2>ARE YOU GUILTY?</h2>
<p class="pn">Young man, young woman, are you guilty, even in
thought? Bear in mind what Christ said: &ldquo;Ye have heard that
it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
after her has committed adultery with her already in his
heart.&rdquo; How many would repent but that they are tied hand
and foot, and some vile harlot, whose feet are fastened in hell,
clings to him and says: &ldquo;If you give me up, I will expose
you!&rdquo; Can you step on the scales and take that harlot with
you?</p>
<p class="pn">If you are guilty of this awful sin, escape for
your life. Hear God&rsquo;s voice while there is yet time.
Confess your sin to Him. Ask Him to snap the fetters that bind
you. Ask Him to give you victory over your passions. If your
right eye offends, pluck it out. If your right hand offends, cut
it off. Shake yourself like Samson, and say:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;By the grace of God I will not go down to an
adulterer&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">There is hope for you, adulterer. There is hope for
you, adulteress. God will not turn you away if you truly repent.
No matter how low down in vice and misery you may have sunk, you
may be washed, you may be sanctified, you may be justified in the
name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Remember
what Christ said to that woman which was a
sinner&mdash;&ldquo;Thy sins are forgiven thee; thy faith hath
saved thee; go in peace;&rdquo; and to that woman that was taken
in adultery&mdash;&ldquo;Go, and sin no more.&rdquo;</p>
<h1><a name="VIII" id="VIII">Eighth Commandment</a></h1>
<p class="pt2">&ldquo;T<span class="sc">hou shalt not
steal</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">D<span class="sc">uring</span> the time of slavery,
a slave was preaching with great power. His master heard of it,
and sent for him, and said:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;I understand you are preaching?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the slave,</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;I
will give you all the time you need, and I want you to prepare a
sermon on the Ten Commandments, and to bear down especially on
stealing, because there is a great deal of stealing on the
plantation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The slave&rsquo;s countenance fell at once. He said
he wouldn&rsquo;t like to do that; there wasn&rsquo;t the warmth
in that subject there was in others.</p>
<p class="pn">I have noticed that people are satisfied when you
preach about the sins of the patriarchs, but they don&rsquo;t
like it when you touch upon the sins of to-day. That is coming
too near home. But we need to have these old doctrines stated
over and over again in our churches. Perhaps it is not necessary
to speak here about the grosser violations of this eighth
commandment, because the law of the land looks after these; but a
man or woman can steal without cracking safes and picking
pockets. Many a person who would shrink from taking what belongs
to another person, thinks nothing of stealing from the government
or from large public corporations, such as streetcar companies.
If you steal from a rich man it is as much a sin as stealing from
a poor man. If you lie about the value of things you buy, are you
not trying to defraud the storekeeper? "It is naught, it is
naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he
boasteth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">On the other hand, many a person who would not
steal himself, holds stock in companies that make dishonest
profits; but &ldquo;though hand join in hand, the wicked shall
not go unpunished.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">A young man in our Bible Institute in Chicago got
on the grip-car, and before the conductor came around to take the
fare, they reached the Institute and he jumped off without paying
his fare. In thinking over that act he said: &ldquo;That was not
just right. I had my ride and I ought to pay the fare.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">He remembered the face of the conductor, and he
went to the car barns and paid him the five cents.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the conductor said, &ldquo;you
are a fool not to keep it.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the young man
said, &ldquo;I am not. I got the ride, and I ought to have paid
for it.&rdquo; &ldquo;But it was my business to collect
it.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it was my business to hand it to
you.&rdquo; The conductor said, &ldquo;I think you must belong to
that Bible Institute.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I have heard few things said of the Institute that
pleased me so much as that one thing. Not long after that the
conductor came to the Institute and asked the student to come to
see him. A cottage-meeting was started in his house; and not only
himself but a number of others around there were converted as a
result of that one act.</p>
<p class="pn">You can hardly take up a paper now without reading
of some cashier of a bank who has become a defaulter, or of some
large swindling operation that has ruined scores, or of some
breach of trust, or fraudulent failure in business. These things
are going on all over the land.</p>
<p class="pn">I would to God that we could have all gambling
swept away. If Christian men take the right stand, they can check
it and break it up in a great many places. It leads to
stealing.</p>
<h2>WHERE THE STREAM STARTS.</h2>
<p class="pn">The stream generally starts at home and in the
school. Parents are woefully lax in their condemnation and
punishment of the sin of stealing. The child begins by taking
sugar, it may be. The mother makes light of it at first, and the
child&rsquo;s conscience is violated without any sense of wrong.
By and by it is not an easy matter to check the habit, because it
grows and multiplies with every new commission.</p>
<p class="pn">The value of the thing that is stolen has nothing
to say to the guilt of the act. Two people were once arguing upon
this point, and one said: &ldquo;Well, you will not contend that
a theft of a pin and of a dollar are the same to God?&rdquo;
&ldquo;When you tell me the difference between the value of a pin
and of a dollar to God,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I will
answer your question.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The value or amount is not what is to be
considered, but whether the act is <i>right</i> or <i>wrong</i>.
Partial obedience is not enough: obedience must be entire. The
little indulgences, the small transgressions are what drive
religion out of the soul. They lay the foundation for the grosser
sins. If you give way to little temptations, you will not be able
to resist when great temptations come to you.</p>
<h2>GOD&rsquo;S WEIGHTS.</h2>
<p class="pn"><i>Extortioner</i>, are you ready to step into the
scales? What will you do with the condemnation of
God&mdash;&ldquo;Thou has taken usury and increase, and thou hast
greedily gained of thy neighbor&rsquo;s by extortion, and hast
forgotten me, saith the Lord God?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn"><i>Employer</i>, are you guilty of sweating your
employees? Have you defrauded the hireling of his wages? Have you
paid starvation wages? &ldquo;Thou shalt not oppress a hired
servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or
of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates. . . .
What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
faces of the poor? saith the Lord God of hosts. . . . Behold, the
hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is
of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which
have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of
sabaoth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">And you, <i>employee</i>, have you been honest with
your employer? Have you robbed him of his due by wasting your
time when he was not looking? If God should summon you into His
presence now, what would you say?</p>
<p class="pn">Let the <i>merchant</i> step into the scales. See
if you will prove light when weighed against the law of God. Are
you guilty of adulterating what you sell? Do you substitute
inferior grades of goods? Are your advertisements deceptive? Are
your cheap prices made possible by defrauding your customers
either in quantity or in quality? Do you teach your clerks to put
a French or an English tag on domestic manufactures, and then
sell them as imported goods? Do you tell them to say that the
goods are all wool when you know they are half cotton? Do you
give short weight or measure? See what God says in His Word:
&ldquo;Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with
the bag of deceitful weights? Thou shalt not have in thy bag
divers weights, a great and a small: thou shalt not have in thy
house divers measures, a great and a small: but thou shalt have a
perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou
have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the Lord
thy God giveth thee. . . . Ye shall do no unrighteousness in
judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. Just balances,
just weights, a just ephah and a just hin, shall ye have.&rdquo;
Are you like those who said: &ldquo;When will the new moon be
gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set
forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and
falsifying the balances by deceit? that we may buy the poor for
silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the
refuse of the wheat?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Show me a people whose trade is
dishonest,&rdquo; said Fronde, &ldquo;and I will show you a
people whose religion is a sham.&rdquo; Unless your religion can
keep you honest in your business, it isn&rsquo;t worth much; it
isn&rsquo;t the right kind. God is a God of righteousness, and no
true follower of his can swerve one inch to the right or left
without disobeying Him.</p>
<h2>STOLEN GOODS A BURDEN.</h2>
<p class="pn">I heard of a boy who stole a cannon-ball from a
navy-yard. He watched his opportunity, sneaked into the yard, and
secured it. But when he had it, he hardly knew what to do with
it. It was heavy, and too large to conceal in his pocket, so he
had to put it under his hat. When he got home with it, he dared
not show it to his parents, because it would have led at once to
his detection. He said in after years it was the last thing he
ever stole. The story is told that one of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
diamonds valued at $600,000 was stolen from a jeweler&rsquo;s
window, to whom it had been given to set. A few months afterward
a miserable man died a miserable death in a poor lodging-house.
In his pocket was found the diamond and a letter telling how he
had not dared to sell it lest it should lead to his discovery and
imprisonment. It never brought him anything but anxiety and
pain.</p>
<p class="pn">Everything you steal is a curse to you in that way.
The sin overreaches itself. A man who takes money that does not
belong to him never gets any lasting comfort. He has no real
pleasure, for he has a guilty conscience. He cannot look an
honest man in the face. He loses peace of mind here, and all hope
of heaven hereafter. &ldquo;As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and
hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right,
shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall
be a fool. . . . Let no man go beyond and defraud his brother in
any matter; because that the Lord is the avenger of all
such.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I may be speaking to some clerk who perhaps took
five cents to-day out of his employer&rsquo;s drawer to buy a
cigar; perhaps he took ten cents to get a shave, and thinks he
will put it back to-morrow&mdash;no one will ever know it. If you
have taken a cent, you are a thief. Do you ever think how those
little stealings may bring you to ruin? Let your employer find it
out. If he doesn&rsquo;t take you into court, he will discharge
you. Your hopes will be blasted, and it will be hard work to get
up again. Whatever condition you are in, do not take a cent that
does not belong to you. Rather than steal, go up to heaven in
poverty&mdash;go up to heaven from the poor-house. Be honest
rather than go through the world in a gilded chariot of stolen
riches.</p>
<h2>RESTITUTION.</h2>
<p class="pn">If you have ever taken money dishonestly, you need
not pray God to forgive you and fill you with the Holy Ghost
until you make restitution. If you have not got the money now to
pay back, will to do it, and God accepts the willing mind.</p>
<p class="pn">Many a man is kept in darkness and unrest because
he fails to obey God on this point. If the plough has gone deep,
if the repentance is true, it will bring forth fruit. What use is
there in my coming to God until I am willing to make it good,
like Zacchaeus, if I have done any man wrong or have taken
anything from him falsely? &ldquo;If the wicked restore the
pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of
life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall
not die. None of his sins that he hath committed shall be
mentioned unto him.&rdquo; Confession and restitution are the
steps that lead up to forgiveness. Until you tread those steps,
you may expect your conscience to be troubled, your sin to haunt
you.</p>
<p class="pn">I was preaching in British Columbia some years ago,
and a young man came to me, and wanted to become a Christian. He
had been smuggling opium into the States.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Well, my friend,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think there is any chance for you to become a
Christian until you make restitution.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;If I
attempt to do that, I will fall into the clutches of the law, and
I will go to the penitentiary.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;you had better do that than go to the
judgment-seat of God with that sin upon your soul, and have
eternal punishment. The Lord will be very merciful if you set
your face to do right.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">He went away sorrowful, but came back the next day,
and said: &ldquo;I have a young wife and child, and all the
furniture in my house I have bought with money I have got in this
dishonest way. If I become a Christian, that furniture will have
to go, and my wife will know it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Better let your
wife know it, and better let your home and furniture go.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Would you come up and see my wife?&rdquo; he asked;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what she will say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I went up to see her, and when I told her, the
tears trickled down her cheeks, and she said: &ldquo;Mr. Moody, I
will gladly give everything if my husband can become a true
Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">She took out her pocketbook, and handed over her
last penny. He had a piece of land in the United States, which he
deeded over to the government. I do not know in all my backward
track of any living man who has had a better testimony for Jesus
Christ than that man. He had been dishonest, but when the truth
came to him that he must make it right before God would help him,
he made it right and then God used him wonderfully.</p>
<p class="pn">No amount of weeping over sin, and saying that you
feel sorry, is going to help it unless you are willing to
confess, and make restitution.</p>
<h1><a name="IX" id="IX">Ninth Commandment</a></h1>
<p class="pt1">&ldquo;T<span class="sc">hou shalt not bear false
witness against thy neighbor</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Two out of the Ten Commandments deal with sins that
find expression by the tongue&mdash;the third commandment, which
forbids taking God&rsquo;s name in vain, and this ninth
commandment, which forbids false witness against our neighbor.
This two-fold prohibition ought to impress us as a solemn
warning, especially as we find that the pages of Scripture are
full of condemnation of sins of the tongue. The Psalms, Proverbs
and the epistle of James deal largely with the subject.</p>
<h2>TRUTH NECESSARY.</h2>
<p class="pn">Organized society of a degree higher than that of
the herding of animals and flocking of birds depends so much upon
the power of speech, that without it we may say society would be
impossible. Language is an essential element in the social
fabric. To its purpose it must be trustworthy. Words must command
confidence. Anything which undermines the truth takes (as it
were) the mortar out of the building and if general, must mean
ruin. Paul said&mdash;&ldquo;Wherefore putting away lying, speak
every man truth to his neighbor: for we are members one of
another.&rdquo; Note the reason given&mdash;&ldquo;we are members
one of another.&rdquo; All community, all union and fellowship
would be shattered if a man did not know whether to believe his
neighbor or not.</p>
<p class="pn">The transgressions of this commandment are very
varied in form, and very frequent. Men and women of all ages have
to guard against them. They include some of the most besetting
sins. David said in his haste&mdash;&ldquo;All men are
liars.&rdquo; Some one has remarked that if he had been living
nowadays, he might say it without haste and not be very far wide
of the truth.</p>
<h2>PERJURY.</h2>
<p class="pn">The bearing of false witness is forbidden, but this
must not be limited merely to testimony given in the law court or
under oath. Isn&rsquo;t it a condemnation that men have to be put
under oath in order to make sure of their speaking the truth? As
a legal offence, <i>perjury</i>&mdash;the bearing of false
witness when under oath&mdash;is one of the most serious crimes
that can be committed. Nearly every civilized nation visits it
with heavy punishment. Unless promptly checked, it would shake
the very foundations of justice.</p>
<p class="pn"><i>Lying</i>&mdash;uttering or acting
falsehood&mdash;and <i>slander</i>&mdash;the spreading of false
reports tending to destroy the reputation of another&mdash;are
two of the most common violations of this commandment.</p>
<h2>LYING.</h2>
<p class="pn">We have got nowadays so that we divide lies into
white lies and black lies, society lies, business lies, etc. The
Word of God knows no such letting-down of the standard. A lie is
a lie, no matter what are the circumstances under which it is
uttered, or by whom. I have heard that in Siam they sew up the
mouth of a confirmed liar. I am afraid if that was the custom in
America, a good many would suffer. Parents should begin with
their children while they are young and teach them to be strictly
truthful at all times. There is a proverb: &ldquo;A lie has no
legs.&rdquo; It requires other lies to support it. Tell one lie
and you are forced to tell others to back it up.</p>
<h2>SLANDER.</h2>
<p class="pn">You don&rsquo;t like to have any one bear false
witness against you, or help to ruin your character or
reputation: then why should you do it to others? How public men
are slandered in this country! None escape, whether good or bad.
Judgment is passed upon them, their family, their character, by
the press and by individuals who know little or nothing about
them. If one tenth that is said and written about our public men
was true, half of them should be hung. Slander has been called
&ldquo;tongue murder.&rdquo; Slanderers are compared to flies
that always settle on sores, but do not touch a man&rsquo;s good
parts.</p>
<p class="pn">If the archangel Gabriel should come down to earth
and mix in human affairs, I believe his character would be
assailed inside of forty-eight hours. Slander called Christ a
gluttonous man and a winebibber. He claimed to be the Truth, but
instead of worshipping Him, men took Him and crucified Him.</p>
<p class="pn">When any one spoke evil of another in the presence
of Peter the Great, he used promptly to stop him, and say:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Well, now, has he not got a bright side?
Tell me what you know good of him. It is easy to splash mud, but
I would rather help a man to keep his coat clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I need not stop to run through the whole catalogue
of sins that are related to these three. False
rumor&mdash;exaggeration&mdash;misrepresentation&mdash;insinuation&mdash;gossip&mdash;equivocation&mdash;holding
back of the truth when it is due and right to tell
it&mdash;disparagement&mdash;perversion of meaning: these are
common transgressions of this ninth commandment, differing in
form and degree of guilt according to the motive or manner of
their expression. They bear false witness against a man before
the tribunal of public opinion&mdash;a court whose judgment none
of us escape. As so much of our life is passed in public view,
any untruth that leads to a false judgment is a grievous
wrong.</p>
<h2>A TEST OF TRUE RELIGION.</h2>
<p class="pn">Government of the tongue is made the test of true
religion by James. &ldquo;If any man among you seem to be
religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own
heart, this man&rsquo;s religion is vain. . . . For in many
things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is
a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body:&rdquo;
Just as a doctor looks at the tongue and can tell the condition
of the bodily health, so a man&rsquo;s words are an index of what
is within. Truth will spring from a good heart: falsehood and
deceit from a corrupt heart. When Ananias kept back part of the
price of the land, Peter asked him&mdash;&ldquo;Why hath
S<span class="sc">atan</span> filled <span class="sc">thine
heart</span> to lie unto the Holy Ghost?&rdquo; Satan is the
father of lies and the promoter of lies:</p>
<h2>FOR GOOD OR EVIL.</h2>
<p class="pn">The tongue can be an instrument of untold good or
incalculable evil. Some one has said that a sharp tongue is the
only edged tool that grows keener with constant use. &ldquo;Thy
tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
deceitfully. . . . They have sharpened their tongues like a
serpent; adders&rsquo; poison is under their lips. . . . The
mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth
the mouth of the wicked. . . . A wholesome tongue is a tree of
life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit, . .
.&rdquo; Bishop Hall said that the tongues of busybodies are like
the tails of Samson&rsquo;s foxes&mdash;they carry firebrands and
are enough to set the whole field of the world in a flame.
&ldquo;Behold, we put bits in the horses&rsquo; mouths that they
may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. Behold also the
ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce
winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm,
whithersoever the governor listeth. Even so the tongue is a
little member, and boasteth great things. Behold how great a
matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world
of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth
the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it
is set on fire of hell. For every kind of beasts, and of birds,
and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed and hath been
tamed by mankind: but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly
evil, full of deadly poison. Therewith bless we God, even the
Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the
similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and
cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. Doth a
fountain send forth at the same time sweet water and bitter? Can
the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine
figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. Who is
a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out
of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But if
ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and
lie not against the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Blighted hopes and blasted reputations are witness
to its awful power. In many cases the tongue has murdered its
victims. Can we not all recall cases where men and women have
died under the wounds of calumny and misrepresentation? History
is full of such cases.</p>
<h2>WORDS NEVER CALLED BACK.</h2>
<p class="pn">The most dangerous thing about it is that a word
once uttered can never be obliterated. Some one has said that
lying is a worse crime than counterfeiting. There is some hope of
following up bad coins until they are all recovered; but an evil
word can never be overtaken. The mind of the hearer or reader has
been poisoned, and human devices cannot reach in and cleanse it.
Lies can never be called back.</p>
<p class="pn">A woman who was well known as a scandal-monger,
went and confessed to the priest. He gave her a ripe thistle-top,
and told her to go out and scatter the seeds one by one. She
wondered at the penance, but obeyed; then she came and told the
priest. He next told her to go and gather again the scattered
seeds. Of course she saw that it was impossible. The priest used
it as an object-lesson to cure her of the sin of scandalous
talk.</p>
<h2>THE FATE OF THE LIAR AND SLANDERER.</h2>
<p class="pn">These sins are devilish, and the Bible is severe in
its denunciations of them. It contains many solemn warnings.
&ldquo;Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will
abhor the bloody and deceitful man. . . . The mouth of them that
speak lies shall be stopped. Whoso privily slandereth his
neighbor, him will I cut off. . . . Lying lips are an abomination
to the Lord: but they that deal truly are His delight. . . . By
thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
condemned. . . . All liars shall have their part in the lake
which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second
death.&rdquo; Whoso loveth and maketh a lie shall in no wise
enter into the new Jerusalem.</p>
<h2>HOW TO OVERCOME.</h2>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;But, Mr. Moody,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;how
can I check myself? how can I overcome the habit of lying and
gossip?&rdquo; A lady once said to me that she had got so into
the habit of exaggerating that her friends said they could never
understand her.</p>
<p class="pn">The cure is simple, but not very pleasant. Treat it
as a sin, and confess it to God and the man whom you have
wronged. As soon as you catch yourself lying, go straight to the
person and confess you have lied. Let your confession be as wide
as your transgression. If you have slandered or lied about any
one in public, let your confession be public. Many a person says
some mean, false thing about another in the presence of others,
and then tries to patch it up by going to that person alone. That
is not making restitution. I need not go to God with confession
until I have made it right with that person, if it is in my power
to do so; He will not hear me.</p>
<p class="pn">Hannah Moore&rsquo;s method was a sure cure for
scandal. Whenever she was told anything derogatory of another,
her invariable reply was:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Come, we will go and ask if it be
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The effect was sometimes ludicrously painful. The
talebearer was taken aback, stammered out a qualification, or
begged that no notice might be taken of the statement. But the
good lady was inexorable. Off she took the scandal-monger to the
scandalized to make inquiry and compare accounts.</p>
<p class="pn">It is not likely that anybody ventured a second
time to repeat a gossipy story to Hannah Moore.</p>
<p class="pn">My friend, how is it? If God should weigh you
against this commandment, would you be found wanting? &ldquo;Thou
shalt not bear false witness.&rdquo; Are you innocent or
guilty?</p>
<h1><a name="X" id="X">Tenth Commandment</a></h1>
<p class="pt1"><span class="sc">&ldquo;Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbor&rsquo;s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&rsquo;s
wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor
his ass, nor anything that is thy
neighbor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="pn">I<span class="sc">n</span> the twelfth chapter of
Luke our Saviour lifted two danger signals. &ldquo;Beware ye of
the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. . . . Take heed
and beware of covetousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The greatest dupe the devil has in the world is the
hypocrite; but the next greatest is the covetous man, &ldquo;for
a man&rsquo;s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
which he possesseth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I believe this sin is much stronger now than ever
before in the world&rsquo;s history. We are not in the habit of
condemning it as a sin. In his epistle to the Thessalonians Paul
speaks of &ldquo;the cloke of covetousness.&rdquo; Covetous men
use it as a cloke, and call it prudence, and foresight. Who ever
heard it confessed as a sin? I have heard many confessions, in
public and private, during the past forty years, but never have I
heard a man confess that he was guilty of this sin. The Bible
does not tell of one man who ever recovered from it, and in all
my experience I do not recall many who have been able to shake it
off after it had fastened on them. A covetous man or woman
generally remains covetous to the very end.</p>
<p class="pn">We may say that covetous desire plunged the human
race into sin. We can trace the river back from age to age until
we get to its rise in Eden. When Eve saw that the forbidden fruit
was good for food and that it was desirable to the eyes, she
partook of it, and Adam with her. They were not satisfied with
all that God had showered upon them, but coveted the wisdom of
gods which Satan deceitfully told them might be obtained by
eating the fruit. She saw,&mdash;she desired&mdash;then she took!
Three steps from innocence into sin.</p>
<h2>A SEARCHING COMMANDMENT.</h2>
<p class="pn">It would be absurd for such a law as this to be
placed upon any human statute book. It could never be enforced.
The officers of the law would be powerless to detect infractions.
The outward conduct may be regulated, but the thoughts and
intents of a man are beyond the reach of human law.</p>
<p class="pn">But God can see behind outward actions. He can read
the thoughts of the heart. Our innermost life, invisible to
mortal eye, is laid bare before Him. We cannot deceive Him by
external conformity. He is able to detect the least transgression
and shortcoming, so that no man can shirk detection. God cannot
be imposed upon by the cleanness of the outside of the cup and
the platter.</p>
<p class="pn">Surely we have here another proof that the Ten
Commandments are not of human origin, but must be divine.</p>
<p class="pn">This commandment, then, did not, even on the
surface, confine itself to visible actions as did the preceding
commandments. Even before Christ came and showed their spiritual
sweep, men had a commandment that went beneath public-conduct and
touched the very springs of action. It directly
prohibited&mdash;not the wrong act, but the wicked desire that
prompted the act. It forbade the evil thought, the unlawful wish.
It sought to prevent&mdash;not only sin, but the desire to sin.
In God&rsquo;s sight it is as wicked to set covetous eyes, as it
is to lay thieving hands, upon anything that is not ours.</p>
<p class="pn">And why? Because if the evil desire can be
controlled, there will be no outbreak in conduct. Desires have
been called &ldquo;actions in the egg.&rdquo; The desire in the
heart is the first step in the series that ends in action. Kill
the evil desire, and you successfully avoid the ill results that
would follow upon its hatching and development. Prevention is
better than cure.</p>
<p class="pn">We must not limit covetousness to the matter of
money. The commandment is not thus limited; it reads, &ldquo;Thou
shalt not covet. . . anything. . . .&rdquo; That word
&ldquo;anything&rdquo; is what will condemn us. Though we do not
join in the race for wealth, have we not sometimes a hungry
longing for our neighbor&rsquo;s goodly lands&mdash;fine
houses,&mdash;beautiful clothes,&mdash;brilliant
reputation,&mdash;personal accomplishments,&mdash;easy
circumstances,&mdash;comfortable surroundings? Have we not had
the desire to increase our possessions or to change our lot in
accordance with what we see in others? If so, we are guilty of
having broken this law.</p>
<h2>GODS THOUGHTS ABOUT COVETOUSNESS.</h2>
<p class="pn">Let us examine a few of the Bible passages that
bear down on this sin, and see what are God&rsquo;s thoughts
about it.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;<i>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall
not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither
fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor
abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves,</i> <span class=
"sc">nor covetous</span>, <i>nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Notice that the covetous are named between thieves
and drunkards. We lock up thieves, and have no mercy on them. We
loathe drunkards, and consider them great sinners against the law
of God as well as the law of the land. Yet there is far more said
in the Bible against covetousness than against either stealing or
drunkenness.</p>
<p class="pn">Covetousness and stealing are almost like Siamese
twins&mdash;they go together so often. In fact we might add
lying, and make them triplets. &ldquo;The covetous person is a
thief <i>in</i> the shell. The thief is a covetous person <i>out
of</i> the shell. Let a covetous person see something that he
desires very much; let an opportunity of taking it be offered;
how very soon he will break through the shell and come out in his
true character as a thief.&rdquo; The Greek word translated
&ldquo;covetousness&rdquo; means&mdash;an inordinate desire of
getting. When the Gauls tasted the sweet wines of Italy, they
asked where they came from, and never rested until they had
overrun Italy.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;<i>For this ye know, that no whoremonger,
nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath
any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">There we have the same truth repeated; but notice
that covetousness is called idolatry. The covetous man worships
Mammon, not God.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;<i>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all
the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth,</i>
<span class="sc">hating covetousness</span>; <i>and place such
over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds,
rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Isn&rsquo;t it extraordinary that Jethro, the man
of the desert, should have given this advice to Moses? How did he
learn to beware of covetousness? We honor men to-day if they are
wealthy and covetous. We elect them to office in church and
state. We often say that they will make better treasurers just
because we know them to be covetous. But in God&rsquo;s sight a
covetous man is as vile and black as any thief or drunkard. David
said: &ldquo;The wicked boasteth of his heart&rsquo;s desire, and
blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.&rdquo; I am
afraid that many who profess to have put away wickedness also
speak well of the covetous.</p>
<h2>A SORE EVIL.</h2>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;<i>He that loveth silver shall not be
satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with
increase: this is also vanity. When goods increase, they are
increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners
thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? The sleep
of the laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but
the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. There is
a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept
for the owners thereof to their hurt</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Isn&rsquo;t that true? Is the covetous man ever
satisfied with his possessions? Aren&rsquo;t they vanity? Does he
have peace of mind? Don&rsquo;t selfish riches always bring
hurt?</p>
<p class="pn">The folly of covetousness is well shown in the
following extract: &ldquo;If you should see a man that had a
large pond of water, yet living in continual thirst, nor
suffering himself to drink half a draught for fear of lessening
his pond; if you should see him wasting his time and strength in
fetching more water to his pond, always thirsty, yet always
carrying a bucket of water in his hand, watching early and late
to catch the drops of rain, gaping after every cloud, and running
greedily into every mire and mud in hopes of water, and always
studying how to make every ditch empty itself into the pond; if
you should see him grow grey in these anxious labors, and at last
end a thirsty life by falling into his own pond, would you not
say that such a one was not only the author of his own disquiet,
but was foolish enough to be reckoned among madmen? But foolish
and absurd as this character is, it does not represent half the
follies and absurd disquiets of the covetous man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I have read of a millionaire in France, who was a
miser. In order to make sure of his wealth, he dug a cave in his
wine cellar so large and deep that he could go down into it with
a ladder. The entrance had a door with a spring lock. After a
time, he was missing. Search was made, but they could find no
trace of him. At last his house was sold, and the purchaser
discovered this door in the cellar. He opened it, went down, and
found the miser lying dead on the ground, in the midst of his
riches. The door must have shut accidentally after him, and he
perished miserably.</p>
<h2>A TEMPTATION AND A SNARE.</h2>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;<i>They that will be</i>, (that is, desire
to be), <i>rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many
foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and
perdition</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The Bible speaks of the deceitfulness of two
things&mdash;&ldquo;the deceitfulness of <i>sin</i>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the deceitfulness of <i>riches</i>.&rdquo; Riches are like
a mirage in the desert, which has all the appearance of
satisfying, and lures on the traveler with the promise of water
and shade; but he only wastes his strength in the effort to reach
it. So riches never satisfy: the pursuit of them always turns out
a snare.</p>
<p class="pn">Lot coveted the rich plains of Sodom, and what did
he gain? After twenty years spent in that wicked city, he had to
escape for his life, leaving all his wealth behind him.</p>
<p class="pn">What did the thirty pieces of silver do for Judas?
Weren&rsquo;t they a snare?</p>
<p class="pn">Think of Balaam. He is generally regarded as a
false prophet, but I do not find that any of his prophecies that
are recorded are not true; they have been literally fulfilled. Up
to a certain point his character shone magnificently, but the
devil finally overcame him by the bait of covetousness. He
stepped over a heavenly crown for the riches and honors that
Balak promised him. He went to perdition backwards. His face was
set toward God, but he backed into hell. He wanted to die the
death of the righteous, but he did not live the life of the
righteous. It is sad to see so many who know God, miss everything
for riches.</p>
<p class="pn">Then consider the case of Gehazi. There is another
man who was drowned in destruction and perdition by covetousness.
He got more out of Naaman than he asked for, but he also got
Naaman&rsquo;s leprosy. Think how he forfeited the friendship of
his master Elisha, the man of God! So to-day lifelong friends are
separated by this accursed desire. Homes are broken up. Men are
willing to sell out peace and happiness for the sake of a few
dollars.</p>
<p class="pn">Didn&rsquo;t David fall into foolish and hurtful
lusts? He saw Bathsheba, Uriah&rsquo;s wife, and she was
&ldquo;very beautiful to look upon,&rdquo; and David became a
murderer and an adulterer. The guilty longing hurled him into the
deepest pit of sin. He had to reap bitterly as he had sowed.</p>
<p class="pn">I heard of a wealthy German out west, who owned a
lumber mill. He was worth nearly two millions of dollars, but his
covetousness was so great that he once worked as a common laborer
carrying railroad ties all day. It was the cause of his
death.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;<i>And Achan answered Joshua, and said,
Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and
thus have I done: When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish
garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold
of fifty shekels weight, then I</i> <span class="sc">coveted
them</span>,<i>and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the
earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under
it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">He saw&mdash;he coveted&mdash;he took&mdash;he hid!
The covetous eye was what led Achan up to the wicked deed that
brought sorrow and defeat upon the camp of Israel.</p>
<p class="pn">We know the terrible punishment that was meted out
to Achan. God seems to have set danger signals at the threshold
of each new age. It is remarkable how soon the first outbreaks of
covetousness occurred. Think of Eve in Eden, Achan just after
Israel had entered the Promised Land, Ananias and Sapphira in the
early Christian Church.</p>
<h2>A ROOT EXTRACTOR.</h2>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;<i>For the love of money is the root of all
evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the
faith, and pierced themselves through with many
sorrows</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The Revised Version translates it&mdash;&ldquo;<i>a
root of all kinds of evil</i>.&rdquo; This tenth commandment has
therefore been aptly called a &ldquo;root-extractor,&rdquo;
because it would tear up and destroy this root. Deep down in our
corrupt nature it has spread. No one but God can rid us of
it.</p>
<p class="pn">Matthew tells us that the deceitfulness of riches
chokes the Word of God. Like the Mississippi river, which chokes
up its mouth by the amount of soil it carries down. Isn&rsquo;t
that true of many business-men to day? They are so engrossed with
their affairs that they have not time for religion. They lose
sight of their soul and its eternal welfare in their desire to
amass wealth. They do not even hesitate to sell their souls to
the devil. How many a man says, &ldquo;We must make money, and if
God&rsquo;s law stands in the way, brush it aside.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">The word &ldquo;lucre&rdquo; occurs five times in
the New Testament, and each time it is called
&ldquo;<i>filthy</i> lucre.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;A root of all kinds of evil.&rdquo; Yes,
because what will not men be guilty of when prompted by the
desire to be rich? Greed for gold leads men to commit violence
and murder, to cheat and deceive and steal. It turns the heart to
stone, devoid of all natural affection, cruel, unkind. How many
families are wrecked over the father&rsquo;s will! The scramble
for a share of the wealth smashes them to pieces. Covetous of
rank and position in society, parents barter sons and daughters
in ungodly marriage. Bodily health is no consideration. The
uncontrollable fever for gold makes men renounce all their
settled prospects, and undertake hazardous journeys&mdash;no
peril can drive them back. It destroys faith and spirituality,
turning men&rsquo;s minds and hearts away from God. It disturbs
the peace of the community by prompting to acts of wrong.
Covetousness has more than once led nation to war against nation
for the sake of gaining territory or other material resources. It
is said that when the Spaniards came over to conquer Peru, they
sent a message to the king, saying, &ldquo;Give us gold, for we
Spaniards have a disease that can only be cured by
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Dr. Boardman has shown how covetousness leads to
the transgression of every one of the commandments, and I cannot
do better than quote his words: &ldquo;Coveting tempts us into
the violation of the first commandment, worshipping Mammon in
addition to Jehovah. Coveting tempts us into a violation of the
second commandment, or idolatry. The apostle Paul expressly
identifies the covetous man with an idolater:
&lsquo;Covetousness, which is idolatry.&rsquo; Again: Coveting
tempts us into violation of the third commandment, or
sacrilegious falsehood: for instance, Gehazi, lying in the matter
of his interview with Naaman the Syrian, and Ananias and
Sapphira, perjuring themselves in the matter of the community of
goods. Again: Coveting tempts us into the violation of the fourth
commandment, or Sabbath-breaking. It is covetousness which
encroaches on God&rsquo;s appointed day of sacred rest, tempting
us to run trains for merely secular purposes, to vend tobacco and
liquors, to hawk newspapers. Again: Coveting tempts us into the
violation of the fifth commandment, or disrespect for authority;
tempting the young man to deride his early parental counsels, the
citizen to trample on civic enactments. Again: Covetousness
tempts us into violation of the sixth commandment, or murder.
Recall how Judas&rsquo; love of money lured him into the betrayal
of his Divine Friend into the hand of His murderers, his lure
being the paltry sum of&mdash;say&mdash;fifteen dollars. Again:
Covetousness tempts us into the violation of the seventh
commandment, or adultery. Observe how Scripture combines greed
and lust. Again: Covetousness tempts us into the violation of the
eighth commandment, or theft. Recall how it tempted Achan to
steal a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of
silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight. Again:
Covetousness tempts us into the violation of the ninth
commandment, or bearing false witness against our neighbor.
Recall how the covetousness of Ahab instigated his wife Jezebel
to employ sons of Belial to bear blasphemous and fatal testimony
against Naboth, saying, &lsquo;Thou didst curse God and the
king.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2>HOW TO OVERCOME.</h2>
<p class="pn">You ask me how you are to cast this unclean spirit
out of your heart? I think I can tell you.</p>
<p class="pn">In the first place, make up your mind that by the
grace of God you will overcome the spirit of selfishness. You
must overcome it, or it will overcome you. Paul said:
&ldquo;Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;
fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil
concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: for which
things&rsquo; sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
disobedience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">I heard of a rich man who was asked to make a
contribution on behalf of some charitable object. The text was
quoted to him&mdash;&ldquo;He that hath pity upon the poor
lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will He pay
him again.&rdquo; He said that the security might be good enough,
but the credit was too long. He was dead within two weeks. The
wrath of God rested upon him as he never expected.</p>
<p class="pn">If you find yourself getting very miserly, begin to
scatter, like a wealthy farmer in New York state I heard of. He
was a noted miser, but he was converted. Soon after, a poor man
who had been burned out and had no provisions, came to him for
help. The farmer thought he would be liberal and give the man a
ham from his smoke-house. On his way to get it, the tempter
whispered to him:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Give him the smallest one you
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">He had a struggle whether he would give a large or
a small ham, but finally he took down the largest he could
find.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;You are a fool,&rdquo; the devil said.</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t keep still,&rdquo; the
farmer replied, &ldquo;I will give him every ham I have in the
smoke house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Mr. Durant told me he woke up one morning to find
that he was a rich man, and he said that the greatest struggle of
his life then took place as to whether he would let money be his
master, or he be master of money, whether he would be its slave,
or make it a slave to him. At last he got the victory, and that
was how Wellesley College came to be built.</p>
<p class="pn">In the next place, cultivate the spirit of
contentment. &ldquo;Let your conversation be without
covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for He
hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we
may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what
man shall do unto me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">Contentment is the very opposite of covetousness,
which is continually craving for something it does not possess.
&ldquo;Be content with such things as ye have,&rdquo; not
worrying about the future, because God has promised never to
leave or forsake you. What does the child of God want more than
this? I would rather have that promise than all the gold of the
earth.</p>
<p class="pn">Would to God we might all be able to say with
Paul&mdash;&ldquo;I have coveted no man&rsquo;s silver, or gold,
or apparel.&rdquo; The Lord had made him partaker of His grace,
and he was soon to be a partaker of His glory, and earthly things
looked very small. &ldquo;Godliness with contentment is great
gain,&rdquo; he wrote to Timothy; &ldquo;having food and raiment,
therewith let us be content.&rdquo; Observe that he puts
godliness first. No worldly gain can satisfy the human heart.
Roll the whole world in, and still there would be room.</p>
<p class="pn">May God tear the scales off our eyes if we are
blinded by this sin. Oh, the folly of it, that we should set our
heart&rsquo;s affections upon anything below! &ldquo;For we
brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry
nothing out. . . . Be thou not afraid when one is made rich, when
the glory of his house is increased; for when he dieth he shall
take nothing away: his glory shall not descend after
him.&rdquo;</p>
<h1><a name="Out" id="Out">The Handwriting Blotted Out</a></h1>
<p class="pn">W<span class="sc">e</span> have now considered the
Ten Commandments, and the question for each one of us
is&mdash;are we keeping them? If God should weigh us by them,
would we be found wanting or not wanting? Do we keep the law, the
<i>whole</i> law? Are we obeying God with all our heart? Do we
render Him a full and willing obedience?</p>
<h2>ONE LAW, NOT TEN.</h2>
<p class="pn">These ten commandments are not ten different laws;
they are one law. If I am being held up in the air by a chain
with ten links and I break one of them, down I come, just as
surely as if I break the whole ten. If I am forbidden to go out
of an enclosure, it makes no difference at what point I break
through the fence. &ldquo;Whosoever shall keep the whole law and
yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
golden chain of obedience is broken if one link is
missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">We sometimes hear people pray to be preserved from
certain sins, as if they were in no danger of committing others.
I firmly believe that if a man begins by wilfully breaking one of
these commandments it is much easier for him to break the others.
I know of a gentleman who had a confidential clerk, and insisted
on his going down Sunday morning to work on his books. The young
man had a good deal of principle, and at first refused, but he
was anxious to keep in the good graces of his employer and
finally yielded. He had not done that a great while before he
speculated in stocks, and became a defaulter for $120,000. The
employer had him arrested and put in the penitentiary for ten
years, but I believe he was just as guilty in the sight of God as
that young man, for he led him to take the first step on the
downward road. You remember the story of a soldier who was
smuggled into a fortress in a load of hay, and opened the gates
to his comrades. Every sin we commit opens the door for other
sins.</p>
<h2>ALL HAVE COME SHORT.</h2>
<p class="pn">For fifteen hundred years man was under the law,
and no one was equal to it. Christ came and showed that the
commandments went beyond the mere letter; and can any one since
say that he has been able to keep them in his own strength? As
the plummet is held up, we see how much we are out of the
perpendicular. As we measure ourselves by that holy standard, we
find how much we are lacking. As a child said, when reproved by
her mother and told that she ought to do right: &ldquo;How can I
do right when there is no &lsquo;right&rsquo; in me?&rdquo; All
have sinned and come short of the glory of God. There is none
righteous, no, not one.</p>
<p class="pn">I do not say that all are equally guilty of gross
violations of the commandments. It needs a certain amount of
reckless courage openly to break a law, human or divine; but it
is easy to <i>crack</i> them, as the child said. It has been
remarked that the life of many professors of religion is full of
fractures that result from little sins, little acts of temper and
selfishness. It is possible to crack a costly vase so finely that
it cannot be noticed by the observer; but let this be done again
and again in different directions, and some day the vase will go
to pieces at a touch. When we hear of some one who has had a
lifelong reputation for good character and consistent living,
suddenly falling into some shameful sin, we are shocked and
puzzled. If we knew all, we would find that only the fall has
been sudden, that he has been sliding toward it for years. Away
back in his life we should find numerous <i>cracked</i>
commandments. His exposure is only the falling of the vase to
pieces.</p>
<h2>FALSE WEIGHTS.</h2>
<p class="pn">Men have all sorts of weights that they think are
going to satisfy, but they will find that they are altogether
vanity, and lighter than vanity.</p>
<p class="pn">The moral man is as guilty as the rest. His
morality cannot save him. &ldquo;Except ye repent, ye shall all
likewise perish. . . . Except ye be converted, and become as
little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
heaven.&rdquo; I have often heard good people say that our
meetings were doing good, they were reaching the drunkards, and
gamblers, and harlots; but they never realized that they needed
the grace of God for themselves.</p>
<p class="pn">Nicodemus was probably one of the most moral men of
his day. He was a teacher of the law. Yet Christ said to him:
&ldquo;Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
God.&rdquo; It is much easier to reach was a Lamb without spot or
blemish, His atoning death is efficacious for you and me. He had
no sin of His own to atone for, and so God accepted His
sacrifice. Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to
every one that believeth. We are righteous in God&rsquo;s sight
because the righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus
Christ is unto all and upon all them that believe.</p>
<p class="pn">If we had to live forever with our sins in the
handwriting of God on the wall, it would be hell on earth. But
thank God for the gospel we preach! If we repent, our sins will
all be blotted out. &ldquo;You, being dead in your sins, hath He
quickened together with Him, having forgiven you all your
trespasses, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was
against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
nailing it to His cross:&rdquo;</p>
<h2>LOVE THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW.</h2>
<p class="pn">If the love of God is shed abroad in your heart,
you will be able to fulfil the law. Paul reduced the commandments
to one: &ldquo;Love is the fulfilling of the law.&rdquo; Some one
has written the following:</p>
<p class="pn">&ldquo;Love to God will admit no other God.</p>
<p class="pn">Love resents everything that debases its object by
representing it by an image.</p>
<p class="pn">Love to God will never dishonor His name.</p>
<p class="pn">Love to God will reverence His day.</p>
<p class="pn">Love to parents makes one honor them.</p>
<p class="pn">Hate, not love, is a murderer.</p>
<p class="pn">Lust, not love, commits adultery.</p>
<p class="pn">Love will give, but never steal.</p>
<p class="pn">Love will not slander or lie.</p>
<p class="pn">Love&rsquo;s eye is not covetous.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>ARE YOU READY?</h2>
<p class="pn">It is the height of madness to turn away and run
the risk of being called by God to judgment and have no hope in
Christ. Now is the day and hour to accept salvation, and then He
will be with you. Do you step aside and say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
ready yet. I want a little more time to prepare, to turn the
matter over in my mind?&rdquo; Well, you have time, but bear in
mind it is only the present; you do not know that you will have
to-morrow. Wasn&rsquo;t Belshazzar cut off suddenly? Would he
have believed that that was going to be his last night, that he
would never see the light of another sun? That banquet of sin
didn&rsquo;t close as he expected. As long as you delay you are
in danger. If you don&rsquo;t enter into the kingdom of heaven by
God&rsquo;s way, you cannot enter at all. You must accept Christ
as your Savior, or you will never be fit to be weighed.</p>
<p class="pn">My friend, have you got Him? Will you remain as you
are and be found wanting, or will you accept Christ and be ready
for the summons? &ldquo;This is the record, that God hath given
to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He that hath the
Son hath life: and he that hath not the Son of God hath not
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pn">May God open your heart to receive His Son now!</p>
